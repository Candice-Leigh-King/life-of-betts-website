      <h2>How we manage to travel full-time? üëáüèº ‚úàÔ∏è üí∞</h2><p>We get asked this
      question daily on our Instagram, so I wanted to break it down for you
      guys! It's important to mention that it's been a slow process for us to
      get to the point where we can travel full-time. Back in 2019, we sold
      everything we owned to move to England in the hopes to live in London and
      travel Europe. We went through an immigration lawyer and because Josh is a
      UK citizen (he lived there most of his childhood) we were told we were a
      shoo-in to get accepted. Josh quit his job and started applying for work
      in the UK and I had some interviews lined up for schools in London (at the
      time I was an online ESL teacher). But, after selling everything in
      preparation for our big move we got the dreaded news&hellip;our
      application was denied!</p><p>I got denied entrance because at the time we
      didn't meet the financial requirements. We were so shocked because our
      immigration lawyer had assured us everything would go smoothly and we had
      nothing to worry about. Once the shock wore off we realized we were in a
      pretty bleak situation! We had sold everything and Josh was
      unemployed.</p><p>We quickly went into planning mode and spent the
      following three days researching every possible alternative. It was at
      this time that Josh started his marketing company in an effort to bring in
      an income. We found out that as South Africans we don't need a visa to
      visit Mauritius and at the time flights were R4 000 each. We researched
      food prices and accommodation options and realized we could live in
      Mauritius cheaper than we did at home in South Africa. With some planning,
      we decided to use some of our savings to travel to Mauritius and live
      there as digital nomads for a month&hellip; but life had other
      plans!</p><p>After two weeks in Mauritius, the pandemic hit and we got
      locked down for five months. It was at this time that we really solidified
      our love of being digital nomads. We were able to easily adapt to lockdown
      life in Mauritius because we could continue working online and making an
      income. When we did eventually repatriate home to South Africa, it didn't
      take long before we decided to move into a van and travel around our own
      country as digital nomads.</p><p>So now you know some of the backstories
      leading up to full-time travel. I want to share some of the tips and
      tricks that help us maintain this lifestyle. It mostly comes down to daily
      habits and small changes we make that result in big changes to our life
      and finances long-term.</p>

      <p><strong>First up is a very strict budget</strong>&nbsp;<span
      style="font-size: var(--font-size); color: var(--color-carbon);
      font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">that we have
      adhered to for years. This was something we implemented into our lives
      about five years ago. We were in debt and couldn&rsquo;t seem to break out
      of our bad spending habits. We decided enough was enough so we started
      having weekly meetings to figure out our spending habits. This is still
      something we do to this day! We usually meet on a Sunday evening for 20
      minutes, we both bring our diaries and we chat about the upcoming week.
      This allows us to communicate where we are financially, what expenses are
      coming up that week such as birthdays, date nights, functions, etc, and
      what our food, travel, and entertainment budget looks like for the week
      ahead. This really helps us stay on track with our monthly budget and made
      a big difference to us both feeling more at ease with our
      finances.</span></p><p><strong>Tip number two is to cut unnecessary
      costs</strong> such as new clothing, eating out, latest technology, etc.,
      and rather save towards experiences and travel over material possessions.
      This isn&rsquo;t for everyone and that&rsquo;s totally okay! It&rsquo;s
      just something that makes a big financial difference for
      us.</p><p><strong>Our third tip is work-related. </strong>It made a big
      difference to both be self-employed and work full-time jobs remotely. This
      took time to build but allows us flexibility in our schedules. At first,
      it was just Josh being self-employed and I was an online ESL teacher for a
      company called KKTALKEE. But, in 2021 my company closed down which forced
      me to rethink my work situation. I was fortunate enough that our social
      media had grown to a point where I could make an income through hotel
      content creation and brand collaborations.</p><p><strong>Next up is
      creating multiple revenue streams.</strong> For us, this looks like our
      Ebooks and digital products, investments, content creation, hotel work,
      and Joshie&rsquo;s marketing company. Again, this takes time to build but
      it&rsquo;s a great way to diversify your monthly income and ensure that if
      something does come up, you have alternative incomes to rely
      on.</p><p><strong>The fifth tip we have is to live below your
      means.</strong> For us, this looks like living in a van/backpacking. Van
      life can be really affordable when you travel slowly and backpacking works
      the same way. You give up some comforts (hot water, privacy, lots of
      possessions) but save money. There are many ways to travel to a new place
      when traveling full-time&hellip; when you travel very cheaply it can mean
      being uncomfortable. When we weigh up the pros and cons - we would way
      rather give up some comforts but wake up in Thailand! This totally depends
      on you and there is no perfect way to do it. I know there is an initial
      big investment into buying a van/booking flights etc. This is something we
      save for long in advance to avoid going into debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Also on
      this topic is to travel to cheap destinations where your currency is
      stronger and you don&rsquo;t need a visa (can find a list of these
      countries online).</p><p><strong>A big one when traveling internationally
      is to eat local food.</strong> It&rsquo;s delicious and WAY cheaper! This
      is something we always encourage people to do. I know it can be initially
      daunting to try unfamiliar food and eat at street cafes when traveling but
      with some online research, you can find lots of great cafes with good
      reviews.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tip number seven is research, research,
      research! </strong>We don&rsquo;t do any travel (van or backpack) without
      thorough research first. We learn about culture, food prices, transport
      prices, accommodation prices, and safety. We make sure we are familiar
      with which internet provider we need to secure so we can work in foreign
      countries. We learn some basic vocabulary to ensure we can communicate
      respectfully with locals. We watch endless YouTube videos, read online
      blogs, and scour the internet for information on the new location. This
      allows us to budget correctly for our visit, and it also ensures we plan
      our accommodation correctly</p>

      <p><strong>Our final tip today is to save for big purchases instead of
      going into debt.</strong> When we want something such as a new phone or
      camera etc we save up and buy it for cash and even then we buy second
      hand.</p>
