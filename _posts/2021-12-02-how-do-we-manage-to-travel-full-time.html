      <p>We get asked this question daily over on our Instagram so I wanted to
      break it down for you guys! It's important to mention that it's been a
      slow process for us to get to the point where we can travel full-time.
      Back in 2019, we sold everything we owned to move to England in the hopes
      to live in London and travel Europe. We went through an immigration lawyer
      and because Josh is a UK citizen (he lived there most of his childhood) we
      were told we were a shoo-in to get accepted. Josh quit his job and started
      applying for work in the UK and I had some interviews lined up for schools
      in London (at the time I was an online ESL teacher). But, after selling
      everything in preparation for our big move we got the dreaded news…our
      application was denied! </p><p>
        I got denied entrance because at the time we didn't meet the financial requirements. We were so shocked because our immigration lawyer had assured us everything would go smoothly and we had nothing to worry about. Once the shock wore off we realized we were in a pretty bleak situation! We had sold everything and Josh was unemployed. </p><p>
        We quickly went into planning mode and spent the following three days researching every possible alternative. It was at this time that Josh started his marketing company in an effort to bring in an income. We found out that as South Africans we don't need a visa to visit Mauritius and at the time flights were R4 000 each. We researched food prices and accommodation options and realized we could live in Mauritius on less of a budget than we did at home in South Africa. With some planning, we decided to use some of our savings to travel to Mauritius and live there as digital nomads for a month… but life had other plans! </p><p>
        After two weeks in Mauritius, the pandemic hit and we got locked down for five months. It was at this time that we really solidified our love of being digital nomads. We were able to easily adapt to lockdown life in Mauritius because we could continue working online and making an income.
        When we did eventually repatriate home to South Africa, it didn't take long before we decided to move into a van and travel around our own country as digital nomads. </p><p>
        
        So now you know some of the backstories leading up to full-time travel. I want to share some of the tips and tricks that help us maintain this lifestyle. It mostly comes down to daily habits and small changes we make that result in big changes to our life and finances long-term.</p>
