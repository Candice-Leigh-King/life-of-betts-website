      <h1>What it cost us to get our caravan on the road</h1><p>Before we <a
      href="/blog-categories/van-life.html">converted and lived in our van,
      Ivy,</a> we lived and <a href="/shop-categories/shop.html">traveled South
      Africa</a> for one full year in a vintage caravan named Stan. This was our
      first taste of 'van life' and we absolutely loved it! Stan the caravan was
      a very budget-friendly way to live and travel. There were no luxuries in
      this little caravan but it really showed us how little we needed to live
      and be happy. Living so budget-friendly also allowed us space to save
      towards our own van build and still pursue our dream of full-time travel.
      We traveled a large portion of South Africa in this caravan and grew our
      online audience from 0 to 30 000 followers too! It was an incredible year
      but it wasn't easy. We had to adapt to living in a tiny space, facing huge
      storms and major damage to our tiny home, being far away from everything
      we knew and loved, and pretty much always living outside our comfort
      zones! This year on the road helped us grow in so many ways and I wouldn't
      change a thing. I wanted to share all the expenses we faced when we first
      bought this little caravan and how much it actually costs to get a vintage
      caravan on the road.</p><p>When we bought Stan the caravan we had NO idea
      what we were getting into. We had never even slept in a caravan before and
      our camping skills were near nonexistent! We really jumped both feet in
      and figured everything out during the free fall. Fortunately for you, we
      can offer some advice and knowledge so your free fall is a little less
      risky.</p><p>Stan the caravan was considered a vintage caravan because it
      was built in 1988. This means it was more affordable to purchase but it
      also means it lacks the modern build and its parts weren&rsquo;t easy to
      find. We had no idea about this when we bought it. Stan the caravan was
      the FIRST and ONLY caravan we looked at and we bought it immediately. Not
      something we would recommend to others... fortunately for us we had
      Joshie's dad with us and he grew up holidaying in caravans so he was able
      to give us the thumbs up.</p>

      <h4>We found Stan the caravan on Facebook Marketplace</h4><h2>The first
      time we saw Stan the Caravan</h2><p>We found Stan the caravan on Facebook
      Marketplace and we viewed it the same day that it was posted. We had been
      searching the internet for affordable caravans and had come up
      empty-handed. Most caravans posted were closer to R60 000 and the more
      affordable ones looked like a crack den to be polite. Our budget was
      <b>R30 000</b> as this is the amount we had saved up intended for travel.
      Although we had only been looking online for 2 days when we saw the advert
      for Stan... it just ticked all the boxes - a local caravan, immediately
      available and within our price range!</p>

      <p>Stan was advertised for R20 000 and we bought it for R18 000. Stan had
      been a family caravan used for the holidays. But, had been standing for 12
      months because the pandemic had prevented the family from holidaying. We
      now know NOT to buy a caravan that has been standing out in the open for
      12 months because that often leads to leaks, electrical problems, and wood
      rot. Something we didn't even consider at the time.</p><p>I think we were
      SO set on the idea of accomplishing van life in a caravan that we would
      have made anything work. We didn't even have a car when we bought Stan the
      caravan so the previous owners had to tow Stan to Josh's parent's house
      where we were staying for the Christmas holidays. We had been backpacking
      for 12 months prior to coming home for the holidays so all we owned at the
      time was our technology for work and a suitcase of clothing. I remember
      watching Stan get towed up the driveway and thinking "And so our adventure
      begins...".</p><p class="center"><b>FIRST PHOTO OF US WITH STAN ON THE
      NIGHT WE BOUGHT HIM</b></p><p class="center"><img alt=""
      src="/images/blog/stan-the-caravan.jpg" /></p><p>We spent all our free
      time sitting in Stan. We had our morning coffee and sketched out our
      renovation plans. We drank wine in the evenings and dreamed of what was to
      come. Once we had a general idea of what we wanted to accomplish
      build-wise we invited my grandpa over - he is a very skilled builder. We
      explained our vision and we were all set to work. Josh and grandpa
      completely stripped the interior of the rotten wood, extra storage units,
      and kitchen cupboards. We wanted to keep the design simple and
      uncluttered. We knew that we would be living in Stan so we wanted him to
      feel as homely and spacious as possible.</p>

      <h3 class="center">The costs involved in Stan's interior rebuild were
      minimal.</h3><p class="center"><img src="/images/blog/dyi.jpg" /></p><p>We
      did everything DIY and as cheap as we could. We shopped at local charity
      shops for wooden shelves and storage baskets. We also repurposed some of
      the wood from the kitchen shelves we had removed. We used the original
      tabletop and cut a section away to make the counter removable so we could
      have access to the induction stove without losing valuable counter space.
      We added wooden 'lips' to all the shelves in Stan using the repurposed
      kitchen shelves to prevent things from falling off when moving. We also
      repainted the whole interior white, and added the floating jars to the
      kitchen for dry food staples, the paper towel holder, and a collapsible
      countertop.</p><p><strong><em>The prices for everything we bought for the
      interior rebuild are as follows:</em></strong></p><p>Nuts n bolts =
      R40</p><p>Wood, hinges, screws, and glue from MICA = R738</p><p>SPCA
      shelves and baskets = R280</p><p>Caravan Canvas Repair Kit = R 2 x 195=
      R390</p><p>Paint = R630</p><p>Silicone = R50</p><p>Hooks = R30</p><p>5 x
      Jars = R100</p>

      /></p><p>We had to work on some things on the exterior as well. Stan
      needed a new tail lamp on the left hand side. Referring back to vintage
      caravan parts being near impossible to find... we fell prey to a scammer
      on Facebook offering us the part we needed and us paying R500 upfront and
      never receiving the part - lesson learned! We eventually learned that we
      could use an Isuzu tail lamp replacement as it matched Stan's correctly.
      We also had to replace the 7-pin plug that connects Stan's road lights to
      the car.</p>

      <p>Once again, we wanted to keep things as simple and affordable as
      possible. We bought what we could second-hand off Facebook marketplace.
      Fortunately for us - Josh's parents were selling up their South African
      home so we got to inherit some major and minor things for our tiny home. I
      learned how to sew and made some curtains for Stan as I couldn't find
      affordable curtains to fit our many tiny windows. We also had to buy some
      shelves for the fridge as there were none.</p><p><strong><em>The prices

      and were trying to balance our day jobs with the van build and mapping out
      a route to travel.&nbsp; Everything we got in those first few weeks has

      what we spent on our van build - <a
