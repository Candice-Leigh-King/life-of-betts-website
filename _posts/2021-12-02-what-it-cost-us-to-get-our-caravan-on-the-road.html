      <h1>What it cost us to get our caravan on the road</h1> <p>Before we converted and lived in our van, Ivy, we lived and traveled South Africa for one full year in a vintage caravan named Stan. This was our first taste of 'van life' and we absolutely loved it! Stan the caravan was a very budget-friendly way to live and travel. There were no luxuries in this little caravan but it really showed us how little we needed to live and be happy. Living so budget-friendly also allowed us space to save towards our own van build and still pursue our dream of full-time travel. We traveled a large portion of South Africa in this caravan and grew our online audience from 0 to 30 000 followers too! It was an incredible year but it wasn't easy. We had to adapt to living in a tiny space, facing huge storms and major damage to our tiny home, being far away from everything we knew and loved, and pretty much always living outside our comfort zones! This year on the road helped us grow in so many ways and I wouldn't change a thing. I wanted to share all the expenses we faced when we first bought this little caravan and how much it actually costs to get a vintage caravan on the road.</p><p>When we bought Stan the caravan we had NO idea what we were getting into. We had never even slept in a caravan before and our camping skills were near nonexistent! We really jumped both feet in and figured everything out during the free fall. Fortunately for you, we can offer some advice and knowledge so your free fall is a little less risky.
      </p><p>Stan the caravan was considered a vintage caravan because it was built in 1988. This means it was more affordable to purchase but it also means it lacks the modern build and its parts weren’t easy to find. We had no idea about this when we bought it. Stan the caravan was the FIRST and ONLY caravan we looked at and we bought it immediately. Not something we would recommend to others... fortunately for us we had Joshie's dad with us and he grew up holidaying in caravans so he was able to give us the thumbs up.</p>
