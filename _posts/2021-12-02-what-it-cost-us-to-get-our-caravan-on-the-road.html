      <h1>What it cost us to get our caravan on the road</h1> <p>Before we
      converted and lived in our van, Ivy, we lived and traveled South Africa
      for one full year in a vintage caravan named Stan. This was our first
      taste of 'van life' and we absolutely loved it! Stan the caravan was a
      very budget-friendly way to live and travel. There were no luxuries in
      this little caravan but it really showed us how little we needed to live
      and be happy. Living so budget-friendly also allowed us space to save
      towards our own van build and still pursue our dream of full-time travel.
      We traveled a large portion of South Africa in this caravan and grew our
      online audience from 0 to 30 000 followers too! It was an incredible year
      but it wasn't easy. We had to adapt to living in a tiny space, facing huge
      storms and major damage to our tiny home, being far away from everything
      we knew and loved, and pretty much always living outside our comfort
      zones! This year on the road helped us grow in so many ways and I wouldn't
      change a thing. I wanted to share all the expenses we faced when we first
      bought this little caravan and how much it actually costs to get a vintage
      caravan on the road.</p><p>When we bought Stan the caravan we had NO idea
      what we were getting into. We had never even slept in a caravan before and
      our camping skills were near nonexistent! We really jumped both feet in
      and figured everything out during the free fall. Fortunately for you, we
      can offer some advice and knowledge so your free fall is a little less
      risky. </p><p>Stan the caravan was considered a vintage caravan because it
      was built in 1988. This means it was more affordable to purchase but it
      also means it lacks the modern build and its parts weren’t easy to find.
      We had no idea about this when we bought it. Stan the caravan was the
      FIRST and ONLY caravan we looked at and we bought it immediately. Not
      something we would recommend to others... fortunately for us we had
      Joshie's dad with us and he grew up holidaying in caravans so he was able
      to give us the thumbs up.</p>

      <h4>We found Stan the caravan on Facebook Marketplace</h4> <h2>The first
      time we saw Stan the Caravan</h2> <p>We found Stan the caravan on Facebook
      Marketplace and we viewed it the same day that it was posted. We had been
      searching the internet for affordable caravans and had come up
      empty-handed. Most caravans posted were closer to R60 000 and the more
      affordable ones looked like a crack den to be polite. Our budget was
      <b>R30 000</b> as this is the amount we had saved up intended for travel.
      Although we had only been looking online for 2 days when we saw the advert
      for Stan... it just ticked all the boxes  - a local caravan, immediately
      available and within our price range! </p>

      <p>Stan was advertised for R20 000 and we bought it for R18 000. Stan had
      been a family caravan used for the holidays. But,  had been standing for
      12 months because the pandemic had prevented the family from holidaying.
      We now know NOT to buy a caravan that has been standing out in the open
      for 12 months because that often leads to leaks, electrical problems, and
      wood rot. Something we didn't even consider at the time. </p><p>I think we
      were SO set on the idea of accomplishing van life in a caravan that we
      would have made anything work. We didn't even have a car when we bought
      Stan the caravan so the previous owners had to tow Stan to Josh's parent's
      house where we were staying for the Christmas holidays. We had been
      backpacking for 12 months prior to coming home for the holidays so all we
      owned at the time was our technology for work and a suitcase of clothing.
      I remember watching Stan get towed up the driveway and thinking "And so
      our adventure begins...".</p><p> <b>FIRST PHOTO OF US WITH STAN ON THE
      NIGHT WE BOUGHT HIM</b></p><img src="/images/blog/stan-the-caravan.jpg"
      alt=""><p>We spent all our free time sitting in Stan. We had our morning
      coffee and sketched out our renovation plans. We drank wine in the
      evenings and dreamed of what was to come. Once we had a general idea of
      what we wanted to accomplish build-wise we invited my grandpa over - he is
      a very skilled builder. We explained our vision and we were all set to
      work. Josh and grandpa completely stripped the interior of the rotten
      wood, extra storage units, and kitchen cupboards. We wanted to keep the
      design simple and uncluttered. We knew that we would be living in Stan so
      we wanted him to feel as homely and spacious as possible.     </p>

      <p>The costs involved in Stan's interior rebuild were minimal. We did
      everything DIY and as cheap as we could. We shopped at local charity shops
      for wooden shelves and storage baskets. We also repurposed some of the
      wood from the kitchen shelves we had removed. We used the original
      tabletop and cut a section away to make the counter removable so we could
      have access to the induction stove without losing valuable counter space.
      We added wooden 'lips' to all the shelves in Stan using the repurposed
      kitchen shelves to prevent things from falling off when moving. We also
      repainted the whole interior white, and added the floating jars to the
      kitchen for dry food staples, the paper towel holder, and a collapsible
      countertop.</p><p><strong><em>The prices for everything we bought for the
      interior rebuild are as follows:</em></strong></p><p>Nuts n bolts =
      R40</p><p>Wood, hinges, screws, and glue from MICA = R738</p><p>SPCA
      shelves and baskets = R280</p><p>Caravan Canvas Repair Kit = R 2 x 195=
      R390</p><p>Paint = R630</p><p>Silicone = R50</p><p>Hooks = R30</p><p>5 x
      Jars = R100</p>
