      <h1>What it cost us to buy and renovate our van Ivy</h1><p>After a year on
      the road in a vintage caravan, we decided it was time to upgrade our tiny
      home. We had saved every penny towards our dream of building ourselves a
      van so in December of 2021 we sold Stan the Caravan and bought ourselves
      an empty panel van. We looked at many different panel vans, some were too
      small or big, too old, too rusty or the engine was not sounding good. We
      must have already seen close to 10-panel vans when we saw Ivy in a
      Facebook Marketplace advertisement.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, we were
      living in Johannesburg at a campsite called Nkwe, we had just sold Stan
      the caravan but still had our car and we were temporarily renting a
      caravan to sleep in. We drove out to see Ivy, the dealership opened
      especially for us as it was still closed for the festive season. I think
      we knew immediately that Ivy was the one. She was huge and in such good
      condition. She had had one owner before us and had been used as a flower
      delivery truck for weddings. She had a full-service history with Iveco and
      had been in no accidents. Ivy had 260 000km on the clock and ran
      beautifully when we test-drove her.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of days later we
      revisited the dealership with a mechanic who plugged Ivy into a machine
      that checked her engine. When we had the green light from the mechanic we
      made an offer of R116 000 for her and they accepted! It was a surreal
      feeling driving Ivy out of the dealership and into the Johannesburg
      traffic. She felt really big and awkward and we were both quiet in
      deliberation over the huge task before us.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s also
      important to mention that the same day, on our way to buy Ivy, our trusted
      car which had taken us and Stan the caravan around the country
      problem-free for a year,&nbsp; broke down and had to be towed! The total
      cost to repair that car was R18 000 which we had not prepared for&hellip;
      It was a big shock because that car was due to be sold the next day and
      suddenly we had an emergency that dipped into our savings. Fortunately,
      the car was fixed within a few days and we managed to still sell
      it.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>We left Johannesburg a week later driving our new van,
      Ivy.</h4><h3>Heading home to start the build</h3><p>We left Johannesburg a
      week later driving our new van, Ivy. At the time, Ivy was still an empty
      panel van with everything that we owned loaded in the back. We drove down
      to Kwa-Zulu Natal where we planned to do the renovations.&nbsp; I remember
      feeling so excited as we departed Johannesburg, excited to embrace this
      new challenge, and excited to be returning to our home province after a
      year on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Ivy was serviced and cleaned then parked at
      Ruthie&rsquo;s grandpa&rsquo;s house to await her rebirth into what we
      hoped would be our new home on wheels. We had already planned the interior
      build, as we had had the dream of our van for so long and we had lived in
      a caravan for a year so we knew what we needed.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>First up was building the subfloor. We used hardwood branding, wood
      primer, plywood, Isotherm, screws, clear wood varnish and Pine T&amp;G. We
      spent approximately R2388 to complete the flooring.</p>

      <p>Once again, we wanted to keep things as simple and affordable as
      possible. We bought what we could second-hand off Facebook marketplace.
      Fortunately for us - Josh's parents were selling up their South African
      home so we got to inherit some major and minor things for our tiny home. I
      learned how to sew and made some curtains for Stan as I couldn't find
      affordable curtains to fit our many tiny windows. We also had to buy some
      shelves for the fridge as there were none.</p><p><strong><em>The prices
      for everything we bought houseware, decor, and
      appliances:</em></strong></p><p>Material for curtains =
      R350</p><p>Slow-cooker (second hand) = R300</p><p>Macrame hanging fruit
      holder = R250</p><p>Induction stove = R899</p><p>Toaster = R299</p><p>Safe

      tub for dishes = R50</p><p>Fake mother of pearls plant =

      buying Stan to hitting the road took us 9 weeks from start to finish. Why
      so quick? Well, Josh's parents sold the house and we had to be out of
      there by mid-March 2021. It was a crazy few weeks! We were constantly busy
      and were trying to balance our day jobs with the van build and mapping out
      a route to travel.&nbsp; Everything we got in those first few weeks has
      done us well over the past 8 months of living full-time on the
      road.</p><p>So.... what did it cost us to get Stan on the
      road?&nbsp;</p><p>The total of all the expenses adds up to <strong>R27
      276.00. </strong>We made it under budget which was great!</p><p>&nbsp;I
      hope this has been informative for you. We will be posting more about the
      build and all the details on a future blog. We will also post about the
      costs we have had since those first few months. Keep an eye out for those
      blogs.&nbsp;</p>
