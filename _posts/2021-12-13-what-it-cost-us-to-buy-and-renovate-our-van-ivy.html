      <h1>What it cost us to buy and renovate our van Ivy</h1><p>After a year on
      the road in a vintage caravan, we decided it was time to upgrade our tiny
      home. We had saved every penny towards our dream of building ourselves a
      van so in December of 2021 we sold Stan the Caravan and bought ourselves
      an empty panel van. We looked at many different panel vans, some were too
      small or big, too old, too rusty or the engine was not sounding good. We
      must have already seen close to 10-panel vans when we saw Ivy in a
      Facebook Marketplace advertisement.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, we were
      living in Johannesburg at a campsite called Nkwe, we had just sold Stan
      the caravan but still had our car and we were temporarily renting a
      caravan to sleep in. We drove out to see Ivy, the dealership opened
      especially for us as it was still closed for the festive season. I think
      we knew immediately that Ivy was the one. She was huge and in such good
      condition. She had had one owner before us and had been used as a flower
      delivery truck for weddings. She had a full-service history with Iveco and
      had been in no accidents. Ivy had 260 000km on the clock and ran
      beautifully when we test-drove her.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of days later we
      revisited the dealership with a mechanic who plugged Ivy into a machine
      that checked her engine. When we had the green light from the mechanic we
      made an offer of <strong>R116 000</strong> for her and they accepted! It
      was a surreal feeling driving Ivy out of the dealership and into the
      Johannesburg traffic. She felt really big and awkward and we were both
      quiet in deliberation over the huge task before us.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s
      also important to mention that the same day, on our way to buy Ivy, our
      trusted car which had taken us and Stan the caravan around the country
      problem-free for a year,&nbsp; broke down and had to be towed! The total
      cost to repair that car was <strong>R18 000</strong> which we had not
      prepared for&hellip; It was a big shock because that car was due to be
      sold the next day and suddenly we had an emergency that dipped into our
      savings. Fortunately, the car was fixed within a few days and we managed
      to still sell it.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>We left Johannesburg a week later driving our new van,
      Ivy.</h4><h3>Heading home to start the build</h3><p>We left Johannesburg a
      week later driving our new van, Ivy. At the time, Ivy was still an empty
      panel van with everything that we owned loaded in the back. We drove down
      to Kwa-Zulu Natal where we planned to do the renovations.&nbsp; I remember
      feeling so excited as we departed Johannesburg, excited to embrace this
      new challenge, and excited to be returning to our home province after a
      year on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Ivy was serviced and cleaned then parked at
      Ruthie&rsquo;s grandpa&rsquo;s house to await her rebirth into what we
      hoped would be our new home on wheels. We had already planned the interior
      build, as we had had the dream of our van for so long and we had lived in
      a caravan for a year so we knew what we needed.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>First up was building the subfloor. We used hardwood branding, wood
      primer, plywood, Isotherm, screws, clear wood varnish and Pine T&amp;G. We
      spent approximately R2388 to complete the flooring.</p>

      1024w" src="/uploads/img-1270.jpg" /></p><p>Josh installed the wiring and
      electrics with some help from his Dad (An Electrical engineer). The
      electrical system was dual voltage, 240Vac for socket outlets and 12V for
      lights. The internal cables were 3 core 1.5mm flexibles which would handle
      both the power requirements and the variable temperatures. The socket
      outlets were standard domestic type and were fitted to the wooden
      panelling.&nbsp;</p><p>The lights and water pump systems were 12V and were
      wired in the same 1,5mm 3-core flexible cable. All the circuits were
      protected from overload and short circuits by MCB (Miniature Circuit
      Breakers) housed in a DB (Distribution Board). The DB was split into 2
      sections, 1 for the 240Vac and 1 for the 12V DC.</p><p>The electrical
      system had a duel feed, 1, direct from the mains via a connecting cable
      and 2, via a 1,5KVa Inverter supplied by 2 x 100Am/Hr batteries. These
      batteries can also be charged directly from the engine by way of an
      automatic charging circuit. (It would be possible to add solar panels to
      this same controller as needed). The total for the electrical setup was
      <strong>R3880</strong> not including the inverter and batteries.&nbsp;</p>

      Sealant, a Fiamma roof vent, and two windows (one that opened and one that
      didn&rsquo;t). We spent approximately <strong>R4900</strong> to buy and

      <p>We built the skeleton framing and completed the cladding on the walls,
      doors and ceiling. We used hardwood branding, wood primer, Isotherm,
      screws and Pine T&amp;G. We spent approximately <strong>R6460</strong>
      building and insulating the walls, doors and ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>Once we
      had the windows, walls, ceiling, doors and floors in it was time to start
      with the main structure build. We began with the basic structure for the
      benches, bed, cupboards and kitchen unit. We used hardwood, wood glue, and
      screws. We spent approximately <strong>R850</strong> building the framing.
      We used a mix of Pine T&amp;G and plywood to complete the structures which
      cost approximately <strong>R1000</strong> as we used leftover pieces as
      much as possible. We also completed the drawers and cupboards which cost
      approximately <strong>R800</strong>.</p><p>We used Saligna for our kitchen
      countertops and painted them with three coats of clear wood varnish. We
      spent approximately <strong>R3500</strong> completing the countertops
      including the hinges and screws.</p>

      and painted we started loading in the appliances and decor which mostly
      came from our caravan but we did buy a few things. I sewed some blackout
      curtains and we bought a small spice shelf and mirror from the charity
      shop. We bought a Kexin gas oven which I adore! After a year of using one
      pan induction in the caravan, we splurged on a little gas oven for Ivy.
      The price for the oven was <strong>R4500</strong> and we bought a new gas
      bottle to go with it for <strong>R699</strong>.</p><p>We were fortunate
      enough to partner with some amazing brands such as SnoMaster South Africa
      and The Mattress Warehouse who sponsored our awesome 75L dual-voltage
      fridge/freezer and our super comfortable mattress.&nbsp;</p><p>The total
      cost of buying and renovating Ivy came to approximately<em>
