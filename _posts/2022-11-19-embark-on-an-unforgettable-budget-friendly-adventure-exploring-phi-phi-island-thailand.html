      Baht per person ($16.50) or R275 â›´ðŸŒŠ Our adventure began with a scenic
      ferry ride from Phuket to Phi Phi Island. Cruising through the turquoise
      waters of the Andaman Sea, we marveled at the breathtaking views along the
      way. The ferry ride cost 550 Baht per person or approximately R275
      ($16.50), setting the tone for the mesmerizing experience awaiting
      us.</li><li>Phi Phi Dream - Your Budget-Friendly Oasis - 500 Baht per
      night ($15) or R250 We checked into the delightful Phi Phi Dream, a
      budget-friendly hotel that exceeded our expectations. With private rooms,
      clean bathrooms, and a refreshing fan to keep us cool, it was the perfect
      sanctuary after a day of exploration. The best part? It's conveniently
      located close to everything, allowing us to easily access the island's
      attractions. All this comfort came at a mere 500 Baht per night or
      approximately R250 ($15).</li><li>Food and Drink - A Gastronomic Adventure
      on a Budget - 200-300 Baht per day ($6-9) or R100-150 together Phi Phi
      Island tantalizes the taste buds with its vibrant culinary scene. We
      discovered our go-to spot, Hot Chilli Bar, where we indulged in delicious
      and affordable veggie Pad Thai for only 60 Baht or approximately R30
      ($1.80). To quench our thirst, we sipped on refreshing drinks from Cha
      Chang, priced at a delightful 30 Baht or approximately R15 ($0.90).
      Remember, dining on the islands can be slightly pricier, so budget
      accordingly while relishing the delectable Thai flavors.</li><li>Private
      Longtail Boat Tour - Unleash Your Inner Explorer - 1500 Baht ($45) or R750

      Leh Bay. With crystal-clear waters surrounding us and the wind in our
      hair, we felt like true adventurers exploring hidden gems. The cost for
      this extraordinary experience was 1500 Baht or approximately R750 ($45).
      If you're traveling with a group or looking for a more budget-friendly
      option, you can join a group tour for around 400 Baht per person or
      approximately R200 ($12). We went with Krabi Phi.Phi Don
      Tour.&nbsp;</li><li>Phi Phi Viewpoint - Reach New Heights of Amazement -
      30 Baht per person ($0.90) or R15 Embrace your inner adventurer and
      conquer the short but steep hike to Phi Phi Viewpoint. For a small fee of
