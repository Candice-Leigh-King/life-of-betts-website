  title: A weekend in the Cederberg, South Africa
  description: >-
    In this blog, we share our delightful experience exploring the Cederberg
    Wilderness area over a couple of days. Our stay at Africamps at De Pakhuys
    was nothing short of amazing. We were captivated by the beauty and privacy
    of Tent number 7, which offered breathtaking views and seclusion at the edge
    of the campsite. The luxury tent accommodated up to 5 people and boasted
    modern amenities like hot showers, air conditioning, an indoor fireplace, a
    well-equipped kitchen, a braai (barbecue) area, and a wood-fired hot tub.
    Although self-catering, we had the option to pre-order food baskets from the
    Africamps reception. We indulged in the delectable braai and breakfast
    baskets, which provided us with ready-to-cook ingredients of exceptional
    quality. Our stay at Africamps provided the perfect blend of comfort,
    nature, and culinary delights, leaving us with cherished memories of our
    time in the Cederberg Wilderness area.

      <h3>We just spent a couple of days exploring the Cederberg Wilderness area
      and absolutely loved it! Here is what we got up to...</h3><p>We stayed at
      the amazing <a target="_blank"
      href="https://tinyurl.com/acdplob">Africamps at De Pakhuys</a>&nbsp;in one
      of their luxury tents. Our tent was number 7, which we thought had the
      BEST view and felt completely private as it's the last tent. &nbsp;It's
      important to note that there is a short trek up to this tent but we feel
      it's totally worth it :)</p>

      <p>While staying at Africamps we decided to go explore the surrounds so we
      grabbed our hiking gear and set off into the mountains.&nbsp;</p><p><img
      src="/uploads/img-2184-1.JPG" width="1170" height="2029" /></p><p>We
      followed the waterfall hiking path of 1.5km through the incredible
      Cederberg landscape, which looks like another planet! The hiking trail was
      easy with a few rocky bits. The highlight of the trail was the waterfalls
      cascading down into natural pools overlooking a beautiful valley. Follow
      the white painted lines down to the base pool where you can swim and lay
      on the rocks in the warm winter sun.</p><p><img

      src="/uploads/img-1464-1.JPG" width="1170" height="1967" /></p><p>We have
      wanted to visit the Cederberg Wilderness area for the longest time and it
      did not disappoint. Our feet may have left but our hearts stayed behind.
      We will definitely visit this beautiful place again and we highly
