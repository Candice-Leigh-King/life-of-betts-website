      <h3>We just spent a couple of days exploring the Cederberg Wilderness area
      and absolutely loved it! Here is what we got up to...</h3><p>We stayed at
      the amazing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="
      https://tinyurl.com/acdplob">Africamps at De Pakhuys</a>&nbsp;in one of
      their luxury tents. Our tent was number 7, which we thought had the BEST
      view and felt completely private as it's the last tent. &nbsp;It's
      important to note that there is a short trek up to this tent but we feel
      it's totally worth it :)</p>

      <p>While staying at Africamps we decided to go explore the surrounds so we
      grabbed our hiking gear and set off into the mountains.&nbsp;</p><p><img
      src="/uploads/img-2184-1.JPG" width="1170" height="2029" /></p><p>We
      followed the waterfall hiking path of 1.5km through the incredible
      Cederberg landscape, which looks like another planet! The hiking trail was
      easy with a few rocky bits. The highlight of the trail was the waterfalls
      cascading down into natural pools overlooking a beautiful valley. Follow
      the white painted lines down to the base pool where you can swim and lay
      on the rocks in the warm winter sun.</p><p><img

      wanted to visit the Cederberg Wilderness area for the longest time and it
      did not disappoint. Our feet may have left but our hearts stayed behind.
      We will definitely visit this beautiful place again and we highly

      <h3 class="center">The costs involved in Stan's interior rebuild were
      minimal.</h3><p class="center"><img src="/images/blog/dyi.jpg" /></p><p>We
      did everything DIY and as cheap as we could. We shopped at local charity
      shops for wooden shelves and storage baskets. We also repurposed some of
      the wood from the kitchen shelves we had removed. We used the original
      tabletop and cut a section away to make the counter removable so we could
      have access to the induction stove without losing valuable counter space.
      We added wooden 'lips' to all the shelves in Stan using the repurposed
      kitchen shelves to prevent things from falling off when moving. We also
      repainted the whole interior white, and added the floating jars to the
      kitchen for dry food staples, the paper towel holder, and a collapsible
      countertop.</p><p><strong><em>The prices for everything we bought for the
      interior rebuild are as follows:</em></strong></p><p>Nuts n bolts =
      R40</p><p>Wood, hinges, screws, and glue from MICA = R738</p><p>SPCA
      shelves and baskets = R280</p><p>Caravan Canvas Repair Kit = R 2 x 195=
      R390</p><p>Paint = R630</p><p>Silicone = R50</p><p>Hooks = R30</p><p>5 x
      Jars = R100</p>

      /></p><p>We had to work on some things on the exterior as well. Stan
      needed a new tail lamp on the left hand side. Referring back to vintage
      caravan parts being near impossible to find... we fell prey to a scammer
      on Facebook offering us the part we needed and us paying R500 upfront and
      never receiving the part - lesson learned! We eventually learned that we
      could use an Isuzu tail lamp replacement as it matched Stan's correctly.
      We also had to replace the 7-pin plug that connects Stan's road lights to
      the car.</p>

      <p>Once again, we wanted to keep things as simple and affordable as
      possible. We bought what we could second-hand off Facebook marketplace.
      Fortunately for us - Josh's parents were selling up their South African
      home so we got to inherit some major and minor things for our tiny home. I
      learned how to sew and made some curtains for Stan as I couldn't find
      affordable curtains to fit our many tiny windows. We also had to buy some
      shelves for the fridge as there were none.</p><p><strong><em>The prices
      for everything we bought houseware, decor, and
      appliances:</em></strong></p><p>Material for curtains =
      R350</p><p>Slow-cooker (second hand) = R300</p><p>Macrame hanging fruit

      buying Stan to hitting the road took us 9 weeks from start to finish. Why
      so quick? Well, Josh's parents sold the house and we had to be out of
      there by mid-March 2021. It was a crazy few weeks! We were constantly busy
      and were trying to balance our day jobs with the van build and mapping out
      a route to travel.&nbsp; Everything we got in those first few weeks has
      done us well over the past 8 months of living full-time on the
      road.</p><p>So.... what did it cost us to get Stan on the
      road?&nbsp;</p><p>The total of all the expenses adds up to <strong>R27
      276.00. </strong>We made it under budget which was great!</p><p>&nbsp;I
      hope this has been informative for you. We have shared a blog detailing
      what we spent on our van build - <a
