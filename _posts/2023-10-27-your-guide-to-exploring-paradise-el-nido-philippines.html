      <p><strong>Getting to El Nido:</strong></p><p>To reach El Nido, you'll
      typically fly into Puerto Princesa Airport (PPS), which is the main
      gateway to Palawan. From there, you have two primary options to get to El
      Nido.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Van/Bus:</strong> The most common and
      economical choice is a van or bus transfer. The journey takes
      approximately 5-6 hours, winding through picturesque landscapes and small
      villages. Just be prepared for some speedy driving and windy
      roads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Direct Flight:</strong> Alternatively, you
      can opt for a direct flight to El Nido Airport (ENI). While quicker, this
      option tends to be pricier. However, the convenience and time saved might
      make it worth considering.</p></li></ol><p><strong>El Nido's History and
      Appeal:</strong></p><p>El Nido's history is as rich and intriguing as its
      natural beauty. The town was named after swiftlet nests (el nido in
      Spanish) found in the region. During the Spanish colonial era, it was a
      favored hideout for pirates due to its maze of limestone cliffs and secret
      lagoons.</p><p>Today, El Nido's allure lies in its stunning landscapes,
      with towering limestone karsts, hidden lagoons, and coral reefs teeming
      with marine life. It's a haven for adventurers, snorkelers, and divers,
      making it a must-visit destination for those in search of pristine,
      unspoiled beauty.</p><p><strong>Transportation within El
      Nido:</strong></p><p>While El Nido doesn't have ride-sharing services like
      Grab, getting around is easy. Tricycles and jeepneys are the go-to modes
      of transport. Tricycles are ideal for short trips within town, while
      jeepneys are more suited for longer journeys to explore nearby
      attractions. There is a food delivery app called Deliverya which only
      caters to El Nido and can be used to order delivery from your favourite
      restaurants.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accommodations in El
      Nido:</strong></p><p>El Nido offers a diverse range of accommodations to
      suit every traveller's needs. Here are a few notable
      options:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://frangipanielnido.com"
