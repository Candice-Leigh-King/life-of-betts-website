      <p><strong>Island-Hopping and Adventure:</strong></p><p>This journey was
      all about immersing ourselves in the beauty of nature. We snorkelled in
      pristine reefs, sunbathed on white powdery beaches, and trekked through
      friendly jungle trails. We watched the sun dip below the horizon from our
      base camp, dined alfresco on the day's fresh catch, and fell asleep under
      the stars in traditional beachfront kubos for a back-to-basics, no-frills
      island experience.</p><p><strong>Disconnect to
      Reconnect:</strong></p><p>Leaving our devices behind (except for our
      trusty camera), we fully embraced the simplicity of island life. It was a
      refreshing change of pace as we reconnected with ourselves, appreciating
      the luxury of living in the moment. Our voyage of discovery began aboard a
      spacious traditional pumpboat, and the best part was sharing this
      experience with five other like-minded travellers.</p><p>One of the most
      unexpected and beautiful aspects of our journey was the friendships we
      forged with our fellow travellers. Hailing from different corners of the
      world, our ages ranged from 24 to 62 years. Despite our diverse
      backgrounds, we all wholeheartedly embraced the activities and adventures
      that came our way. In fact, it was astonishing how quickly we bonded over
      those three days. We became such a tight-knit group that we even came up
      with a group name (Team Lekker). And once we returned to solid ground, we
      couldn't resist the urge to meet up for dinner, where we fondly reminisced
      about our shared island adventure, creating memories that would forever
      bind us together.</p><p><strong>Explore Off the Beaten
      Path:</strong></p><p>Our dedicated crew not only guided us but also became
      an indispensable part of our island-hopping adventure. They led us to
      remote and off-the-beaten-track islands that make up the magical region of
      Linapacan and Culion. These islands were pristine, untouched paradises,
      and it was our crew's expertise that allowed us to explore these hidden
      gems.</p><p>The experience on the boat was nothing short of incredible.
      Our crew was hands-on, always available, and immensely friendly. We were
      always made to feel safe, whether it was while snorkeling, moving between
      boats, or transitioning from the boat to the land. At least two crew
      members were in the water with us at all times while snorkeling, ensuring
      that we had the best guidance and support as we marveled at the underwater
      wonders of Palawan.</p><p>What truly stood out was the exceptional service
      provided by our chefs on board. They prepared mouthwatering fresh food
      meals with a selection of at least six dishes to choose from. The flavors
      were a delightful reflection of the local cuisine, and each meal was a
      culinary treat.</p><p>Every member of the crew was friendly, involved, and
      always available. What set them apart was their genuine enthusiasm for the
      adventure. They not only guided us but also actively participated in the
      activities alongside us. This created an incredible camaraderie, leading
      to exciting beach volleyball games and unforgettable shared
      moments.</p><p>Their extensive knowledge of the region's wildlife was a
      valuable asset. They introduced us to some of the most fascinating
      creatures that call the waters of Palawan, Philippines, home. We had the
      privilege of encountering turtles, starfish, sea snakes, and an
      astonishing array of stunning fish, including parrotfish, angelfish,
      butterflyfish, and clownfish. With the crew's guidance, we gained a deeper
      appreciation of the vibrant marine life in these waters, making each
      snorkeling excursion an educational and enchanting
      experience.</p><p><strong>Sleep under the Stars:</strong></p><p>At the end
      of each adventurous day, we cruised to different base camps, where we
      spent the night in open-air traditional kubos. We enjoyed a cold beer as
      we watched the sun set, then gathered with fellow adventurers for an
      authentic Filipino meal surrounded by the soothing sounds of
      nature.</p><p><strong>What to Expect:</strong></p><p>We expected nothing,
      and we enjoyed everything! A Keelooma Voyage was a back-to-basics
      adventure that explored the archipelago around Linapacan. Our itinerary
      wasn't fixed, as we adapted to sea and weather conditions to show us the
      best island and snorkeling spots.</p><p><strong>Respectful
      Exploration:</strong></p><p>We visited uninhabited islands and
      communities, and we were lucky to work and live amongst the locals. The
      Filipino culture was welcoming, and we respected their right to
      privacy.</p><p><strong>What Was Included:</strong></p><ul><li>Boat
      excursions to 3 remote islands per day</li><li>2 nights accommodation in
      one of our kubos (mattress, bedding, pillow, and a mosquito
      net)</li><li>Buffet meals, snacks, and drinks
      (water/squash/tea/coffee)</li><li>Snorkel and Mask (fins not
      included)</li><li>Linapacan Eco-Tourism Development
      Fee</li></ul><p><strong>What Wasn't
      Included:</strong></p><ul><li>Towels/Toiletries</li><li>Can/Bottle Drinks
      (Coke/Sprite/Beers)</li><li>Flights to/from El
      Nido/Coron</li><li>Accommodation in El Nido/Coron before/after the island
      stay</li><li>Travel insurance</li></ul><p><strong>Packing
      Essentials:</strong></p><p>We made sure to bring a <a target="_blank"

      disconnected from the world and reconnected with the beauty of the
      Philippines, creating memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
