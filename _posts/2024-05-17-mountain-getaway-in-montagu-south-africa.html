      <h2>The Barn House</h2><p>If you're dreaming of a getaway that mixes
      modern design with the wild beauty of the Klein Karoo, <a
      href="https://www.abrikooskloof.co.za/designer-cabins/" title="Website"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Barn House</a> at Abrikoos Kloof
      Reserve is where you need to be. This stylish cabin is all about mountain
      views and luxurious living, offering a perfect retreat for those who crave
      both adventure and comfort.</p><p>The Barn House is an architectural gem
      with its ultra-modern A-frame design. This cabin is more than just a
      pretty face, though. Inside, you’ll find a full kitchen, a cozy living
      room with not one but two fireplaces, and a bedroom that’s perfect for
      snuggling up after a day of exploring. The highlight? A freestanding bath
      with a view that makes you feel like you’re soaking in the middle of the
      renosterveld, plus an outdoor shower to keep you feeling close to
      nature.</p><p>The layout is smart and spacious. The bedroom, with its own
      fireplace, is at one end; the bathroom, featuring a wall-to-ceiling
      window, is in the middle; and the kitchenette and lounge area, with a
      large open fireplace, is at the other end. Every room offers uninterrupted
      mountain views thanks to large windows and glass doors, letting you bask
      in the natural light and scenery.</p><p>Outside, the fun continues. A
      private swimming pool and a wood-fired hot tub provide perfect spots to
      relax while taking in the stunning landscape. There’s also a boma with a
      pizza oven and braai area, making it easy to enjoy outdoor dining under
      the stars. If you’re feeling adventurous, hit the hiking trail that starts
      right from the house and winds into the mountains.</p><p>The decor of <a
      href="https://www.abrikooskloof.co.za/designer-cabins/" title="Website"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Barn House</a> is a tasteful blend of
      modern barn aesthetics and chic design elements, creating an ambiance
      that's both stylish and welcoming. Locally produced Fijn Botanicals and
      sumptuous bedding and towels add to the luxury, along with two luxurious
      gowns and exclusive Abrikoos Kloof bead bracelets waiting for
      you.</p><p>Whether you’re relaxing by the pool, unwinding in the hot tub,
      or enjoying a homemade pizza under the night sky, <a
      href="https://www.abrikooskloof.co.za/designer-cabins/" title="Website"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Barn House </a>is the ultimate mountain

      <h2>The Mountain House</h2><p>Now, if you think The Barn House sounds
      amazing, wait until you hear about <a
      href="https://www.abrikooskloof.co.za/themountainhouse/" title="Website"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mountain House</a>. Perched high in the
      mountains near Montagu, this ultra-modern cabin might be the most remote
      and peaceful stay we've visited this year.</p><p>The Mountain House’s
      sleek modular design perfectly fits its stunning surroundings. Positioned
      between the Langeberg West and Langeberg East Mountain Catchments, this
      architectural marvel offers sweeping views of the koppies, hills,
      crevasses, and mountain ranges that define the Klein Karoo.</p><p>The
      cabin is divided into two ultra-modern living spaces connected by a wooden
      deck entrance pathway, ensuring privacy and space. Inside, the open-plan
      layout features a lounge with a fireplace, a dining area, and a
      kitchenette, all designed to make the most of the stunning views. Large
      windows and sliding doors invite the outdoors in, making sure you never
      miss a moment of the breathtaking scenery.</p><p>As night falls, step
      outside onto the deck for a star-gazing experience like no other. The
      clear skies of Southern Africa are a sight to behold, filled with
      countless stars twinkling brightly above the mountains. It's a magical
      view that adds an extra layer of enchantment to your stay.</p><p><a
      href="https://www.abrikooskloof.co.za/themountainhouse/" title="Website"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mountain House</a> also offers a unique
      bathing experience. The Devon Slipper freestanding bath is positioned to
      overlook the renosterveld and mountain valleys, letting you unwind in
      luxurious comfort while surrounded by natural beauty. An outdoor shower
      completes the experience, allowing you to connect with nature as you
      refresh.</p><p>Every detail at The Mountain House is thoughtfully curated
      for maximum comfort. From the custom-crafted hardwood extra king-size bed
      with a Sloom Mattress to the locally produced Fijn Botanicals and
      luxurious gowns, everything is designed to make your stay as relaxing as
      possible.</p><p>The fully equipped kitchen lets you prepare your own
      meals, but if you prefer, full catering is also available. Talented chefs
      can prepare delicious meals that showcase the flavours of the region, and
      you can enjoy these meals with panoramic views of the Klein Karoo. To
      complement your meals, curated wine pairings from Abrikoos vineyards add
      an extra touch of sophistication.</p><p>Outside, a stunning pool area
      offers breathtaking views, and a wood-fired hot tub, affectionately known
      as the naughty corner, provides a serene space to unwind. Whether lounging
      by the pool or soaking in the hot tub, you can enjoy the natural beauty of
      the area.</p><p>For an extra touch of luxury, a professional massage
      therapist can be booked prior to check-in, offering personalised wellness
      experiences amidst the tranquil surroundings of The Mountain
      House.</p><p>If you’re looking for an escape that combines complete
      seclusion with modern luxury, <a
      href="https://www.abrikooskloof.co.za/themountainhouse/" title="Website"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mountain House</a> is the place to be.
