      <p>Recently, we visited <a href="https://www.springsteencabins.com/"
      title="link to Springsteen Cabins" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Springsteen Cabins in Tulbagh</a>, and as my mum was
      travelling with us, we checked into the <a
      href="https://www.springsteencabins.com/secret-garden" title="link to
      cabin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Garden Cabin</a>, a
      four-sleeper mountain cabin with a private hot tub. Nestled on the
      mountainside and surrounded by vineyards, Secret Garden offers two
      bedrooms, each with an ensuite and both indoor and outdoor showers. The
      outdoor showers provide breathtaking mountain views, and make the perfect
      spot for a hot morning shower. The open-plan living area includes a
      well-equipped kitchen and an indoor gas fireplace. The fireplace truly
      keeps the cabin warm and cosy; just remember to keep all windows and doors
      closed when it's in use.</p><p class="center"><img

      <p>The highlight of this cabin, like most mountain retreats, is the
      wood-fired hot tub overlooking the mountains. My mum and I spent most of
      the evening relaxing in the hot tub while Josh used the gas braai to cook
      us a delicious dinner. A helpful tip: before you go to sleep, add some
      wood to the hot tub fire so that in the morning, you can hop in and enjoy
      the sunrise.</p><p class="center"><img src="/uploads/img-2645-1.jpg"
      /></p><p class="center">One thing to note is that there is no WiFi at the
      cabin, encouraging guests to disconnect from the digital world and fully
      enjoy the natural surroundings. The deck offers comfortable seating with
      stunning views of the mountains, making it the perfect spot to savour a
      glass of wine while watching the sun go down.</p><p><a
      href="https://www.springsteencabins.com/secret-garden" title="link to
      cabin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Garden Cabin</a> is
      completely off-grid, running on solar and gas, ensuring you won't be
      affected by loadshedding. This self-sufficient setup adds to the sense of
      tranquillity and escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday
      life.</p><p>Guests also have access to various walking trails, perfect for
      those who want to stay active. If it's a hot day, you can cool off in the
      private splash pool. Overall, it's a fantastic stay, especially if you're
      looking for a place that accommodates more than two people per night. And
      an extra bonus, pets are allowed on request!</p><p class="center"><img
      src="/uploads/img-2547.jpg" /></p><p>If you're planning a visit, make sure
      to bring along your favourite books or board games for some cosy indoor
      entertainment. The serene surroundings make it an ideal spot for
      relaxation and reconnecting with nature. Don't forget to explore the local
      wineries and taste some of the region's finest wines. The combination of
      comfort, scenic beauty, and relaxation makes the <a
      href="https://www.springsteencabins.com/secret-garden" title="link to
      cabin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Garden Cabin</a> a truly
      fantastic getaway.</p>
