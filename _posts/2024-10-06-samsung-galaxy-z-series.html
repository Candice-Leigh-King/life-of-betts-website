    Living on the road is an adventure, but it comes with its challenges –
    especially when balancing work and travel. In this blog, Ruthie and I share
    how the Samsung Galaxy Z Series has become our go-to tool for staying
    organised, creating content, and keeping up with business while exploring
    some of the most remote and beautiful places on Earth. From automatic note
    summarising to voice memo transcriptions, it’s like having a personal
    assistant on the go!

      <p>Living on the road is an adventure in itself, but it’s also a challenge
      when it comes to staying organised and running a business. As full-time
      content creators, Ruthie and I have learned to adapt to life in remote
      corners of the world, currently calling the oldest desert in the
      world—Namibia—our office! Our work requires us to stay on top of our
      content, brainstorm ideas, collaborate with brands, and keep track of
      everything we do, all while soaking in the incredible landscapes around
      us.</p><p>Thankfully, the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 has become a
      lifesaver, and one tool that we’ve been relying on more than ever is the
      Note Assist AI tool. I cannot recommend it enough for anyone trying to
      balance work and travel like we do. It’s been the perfect assistant,
      helping us keep everything organised no matter where we are.</p><p></p>

      <p>When we’re travelling, time is a luxury, and we often find ourselves
      jotting down long notes between filming, editing, and exploring. Whether
      it's ideas for new content or notes from meetings with clients, these
      notes can easily pile up. The Galaxy AI feature in Samsung Notes has been
      a game-changer. I love that I can simply tap a button, and Note Assist
      will automatically summarise a lengthy note into something
      digestible.</p><p>No need to scroll through pages of text when I’m racing
      to catch a sunset or scrambling to upload a video before the Wi-Fi cuts
      out.</p><p>And, for someone always juggling multiple tasks, the
      auto-format feature ensures that even my rushed thoughts are neatly
      organised.</p><p>One of the things I adore about travelling is the mix of
      cultures and languages we encounter. Since I’m sometimes creating content
      in both English and another language, the Translate feature has been so
      handy. Whether we’re writing content for local guides or collaborating
      with international brands, being able to live translate our notes into
      another language is a dream. I can easily copy translations into other
      apps or keep them within my notes for later use.</p><p>As a content
      creator, clear and concise writing is key. Note Assist with Galaxy AI
      helps me sharpen that with its automatic formatting, summarising, and even
      spell-checking within Samsung Notes. It’s like having a mini writing coach
      that keeps me on point. And what I love the most? When I’m using the
      Galaxy Z Fold6, I can turn my phone sideways and work in landscape mode,
      which makes everything so much easier. I can see my notes and the
      summarised version side by side, which has been incredibly helpful during
      meetings or when we’re brainstorming for new projects.</p><p>Another thing
      I love about Note Assist is how personal it feels. I’ve been able to
      create customised note covers that help me organise my thoughts in a way
      that feels uniquely mine. Whether it’s colour-coded folders for different
      projects or themed covers for specific trips, it helps bring a sense of
      order to my sometimes chaotic life.</p><p>Oh, and the voice memo
      transcription feature? It’s been a lifesaver. I often record voice memos
      when we’re out hiking or driving long distances, and the ability to
      convert those into transcripts that are instantly saved in Samsung Notes
      is a huge time-saver. Whether it's a fleeting idea for content or an
      important conversation, everything gets recorded and organised, so I never
      lose a thing.</p><p>Living on the road comes with its own set of
      challenges, but the Note Assist with Galaxy AI on the Samsung Galaxy Z
      Fold6 has made my life so much easier. It’s like having a personal
      assistant that keeps me organised and on top of things no matter where I
      am. Whether we’re in the middle of the Namib Desert or about to head into
      a bustling city, I know I can count on these tools to help me create,
      work, and stay on track.</p>
