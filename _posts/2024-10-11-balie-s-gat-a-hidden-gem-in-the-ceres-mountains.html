      <h3>The Glamping Experience</h3><p>Balie’s Gat offers a glamping tent
      called Oupa Tienie that’s completely private and ideal for a family of
      four. Inside, you’ll find one double bed and two singles, making it cozy
      but comfortable. The tent has everything you need—a small kitchen for your
      self-catering needs, an outdoor bathtub (yes, you can soak under the
      stars!), and a braai area for those lekker family braais. And if the
      nights get chilly, there’s an indoor fire and seating area to keep you
      warm.</p><p>The best part? A private rock pool! Enjoy cooling off in your
      own pool just a few steps away, surrounded by mountains.</p><h3>What to
      Do</h3><p>Balie’s Gat isn’t just about chilling, although you could easily
      spend all day at the tent and be perfectly happy! For those looking to
      explore, there are a few beautiful hiking trails nearby that take you
      through some stunning landscapes. And for a real treat, head to the
      waterfall pool—it's the ultimate refreshing swim and the perfect short
      hiking trail,</p><p>Everywhere you look, you’re greeted by breathtaking
      mountain views. Whether you're soaking in the outdoor tub or lounging by
      the pool, the scenery is nothing short of magical. We also recommend
      packing a picnic, towels, and sunblock and heading down to the river rock
      pools for the day!</p><h3>Some Handy Tips</h3><p>There’s no signal or
      Wi-Fi at the tent, which is part of what makes this place so special—it’s
      a proper escape. That said, make sure you do all your shopping before you
      get here so you can really kick back and relax. Firewood and ice are
      available at reception, and if you need to connect to the outside world,
      you can pop by there for some Wi-Fi.</p><p>At R732 per person or R1550 for
      a family of four, Balie’s Gat is an absolute bargain for the peace and
      beauty it offers. Whether you're looking for a peaceful retreat or a
      nature-filled adventure with the family, this spot has it all.</p><p>Have
      you been here before? Let us know what you thought! And if not, you really
      need to add this gem to your bucket list.</p>
