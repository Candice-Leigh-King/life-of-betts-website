      <p>Just an hour from Cape Town, AfriCamps at Doolhof Wine Estate has us
      grinning from ear to ear – another absolute gem from AfriCamps, and we’re
      here for it! This family-friendly glamping spot is located in the
      award-winning Doolhof Wine Estate, right beneath the historic Bainskloof
      Pass at the foot of the Groenberg Mountain Range. You’ll feel like you’re
      tucked away in the Winelands’ own little paradise, with jaw-dropping
      mountain views, lush vineyards, and the Kromme River adding to the
      soundtrack.</p><p>These 16 boutique glamping tents have something for
      everyone: six tents open up onto a meadow with the peaceful river flowing
      nearby, while ten hillside tents offer killer mountain views that are best
      enjoyed from your private wood-fired hot tub. AfriCamps has thought of
      everything here – each tent comfortably sleeps five, with two bedrooms, a
      well-equipped kitchen (yes, it has a stove and an air fryer!), an indoor
      fireplace, and aircon to keep things comfy.</p><p>There’s plenty to keep
      you entertained without ever leaving the estate. The 5 km vineyard hike is
      a must for stunning views and a healthy appetite for the tasting room,
      where you can sip Doolhof’s award-winning wines while tucking into a
      platter or light lunch. Little adventurers have their own mountain bike
      trail, while grown-up riders can try the trails that start on the property
      or head off for more exploring around Wellington. For those looking to
      unwind, you can book a spa treatment directly in your tent. And, of
      course, after a day full of adventure, there’s nothing quite like sinking
      into your own private wood-fired hot tub, surrounded by forest and
      mountain views as the sun sets behind the hills. If you’re up for more,
      the area’s top-notch golf courses and even more wineries await
      nearby!</p><p>Speaking of wine, no stay here is complete without getting
      into the Doolhof wines – they’ve got everything from crisp whites like
      Sauvignon Blanc to full-bodied reds like Merlot and Shiraz. With a
      complimentary tasting included, you’ll leave with a better appreciation of
      the wines (and maybe a bottle or two in hand to keep the holiday vibes
      going when you get home).</p><p>AfriCamps has nailed it with this glamping
      experience, combining all the comforts of home with the adventure of the
      great outdoors. Whether it’s your first Africamps experience or your
      fifth, AfriCamps Doolhof is worth a visit. Have you been to one yet? Let
      us know which Africamps is next on your list!</p>
