      <p>Exploring Europe is a dream for many, but doing it in a <a
      href="https://link.roadsurfer.com/BETTS12" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">rented campervan</a> takes the experience to an entirely
      new level! We chose to journey along the stunning coastal route between
      Valencia in Spain and Saint Tropez in France, and it completely stole our
      hearts. From golden beaches to vibrant cities, the blend of nature and
      culture left us in constant awe! We took our time uncovering the best gems
      at each stop, to ensure this blog is packed with links to all the
      must-visit spots. Highlights of our trip included day trips to Saint
      Tropez, hiking in La Ciotat, savouring pain au chocolat at charming French
      bakeries, and camping by the sea in Cambrils. Travelling in autumn, during
      the shoulder season, was a decision we highly recommend. The days were
      still warm and sunny, but the crowds had thinned out, making it feel like
      we had Europe’s treasures all to ourselves. So here's the ultimate road
      trip itinerary to inspire your own adventure!</p><p class="center"><img

      <p><strong>Our Budget Breakdown</strong></p><p> To help you plan your own
      road trip, here’s a rough idea of what our two-week campervan adventure
      through Southern France and Spain cost us. Keep in mind, we opted for a <a
      href="https://link.roadsurfer.com/BETTS12" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">4-sleeper motorhome</a> with full insurance—if you go for a
      smaller van or fewer amenities, you could save quite a bit! </p><p>Flights
      R10,000 / €522 per person (return flights from South Africa to Valencia).
      </p><p><a href="https://link.roadsurfer.com/BETTS12" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Campervan Rental</a> R35,000 / €1,835 for 14 nights. This
      included full insurance, which we highly recommend for peace of mind.
      </p><p>Fuel Costs R5,850 / €305. The fuel-efficient roadsurfer van helped
      keep costs down, even with all the driving. </p><p>Camping &amp; Aires
      R5,081 / €265. A mix of free camping spots, affordable Aires, and the
      occasional splurge on fancier campsites kept this budget-friendly.
      </p><p>Tolls (France) R1,920 / €100. French tolls can add up, so plan your
      route carefully if you’re on a tight budget. </p><p>Data R900 / €47.
      Unlimited eSIM data for 15 days across Europe. </p><p>Food R4,030 / €210.
      Stocking up at Lidl and cooking in the campervan saved us loads of money.
      </p><p>Restaurants &amp; Cafés R1,920 / €100. We enjoyed dining out
      sparingly, focusing on local favourites without blowing the budget.</p><p

      <p><strong>Recommendations Before You Hit the Road</strong></p><p>Before
      diving into the itinerary, here are some top tips that made our road trip
      smoother and more enjoyable. Trust us—these small details can make a huge
      difference when you’re travelling in a campervan across Europe!</p><hr
      /><ol><li><p><strong>Get an eSIM Before Landing</strong><br />Stay
      connected from the moment you touch down by purchasing an eSIM. We got
      unlimited data for 15 days across Europe for just €47, which meant we
      always had maps, apps, and travel info at our fingertips without worrying
      about roaming costs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Familiarise Yourself with the
      Park4Night App</strong><br />This app will be your lifeline on the road.
      It’s brilliant for finding places to sleep, park, refill water, dump grey
      water, and more. Spend some time getting used to it before your trip so
      you’re ready to go when you hit the road.</p></li><li><p><strong>Carry
      Cash (and Coins)</strong><br />Many Aires and parking areas only accept
      cash—and often just coins—so make sure you have some handy. It’ll save you
      the stress of being stuck without a way to pay for an overnight
      spot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Download Offline Maps</strong><br />Download
      your route on Google Maps before leaving Wi-Fi zones. This was a lifesaver
      when we hit areas with poor reception and needed to
      navigate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shop at Lidl to Save Money</strong><br
      />If you’re trying to keep your food budget low, we highly recommend
      shopping at Lidl. It’s affordable and has great quality groceries. Thanks
      to roadsurfer providing a French Press, we also saved money by making
      coffee in the van instead of splurging at
      cafés.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Use of Free Aires and roadsurfer
      Spots</strong><br />Look out for free overnight Aires, which are rare but
      a great way to save money. Alternatively, check out <a
      href="https://roadsurfer.com/spots/">roadsurferspots</a> for secluded,
      off-the-beaten-path camping sites that are budget-friendly. These often
      provide a more unique and peaceful experience compared to traditional
      campsites.</p></li><li><p><strong>Park Responsibly and Secure Your
      Valuables</strong><br />While we had no issues, we heard warnings from
      other travellers about window smashing when parking on the road. Here’s
      how to stay safe:</p><ul><li><p>Hide valuables out of
      sight.</p></li><li><p>Close your shutters when leaving the
      van.</p></li><li><p>Use the Park4Night app to read reviews about the
      safety of parking areas or stick to Aires.</p></li></ul><p>Taking these
      precautions ensures you’ll have a stress-free
      experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan Your Route, But Stay
      Flexible</strong><br />Having a rough plan is helpful, but van life is all
      about going with the flow. Aires can sometimes be full or closed due to
      construction, so be prepared to adjust. We often stumbled upon even more
      beautiful locations this way!</p></li><li><p><strong>Watch Out for Toll
      Roads</strong><br />Tolls in France can add up quickly. Plan your route
      carefully to avoid unplanned expenses, especially if you’re on a
      budget.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Drive with a Full Water
      Tank</strong><br />While the roadsurfer vans are equipped with large water
      tanks for washing dishes and showering, driving with a full tank can weigh
      the van down and increase diesel costs. Only fill up once you’ve arrived
      at your destination.</p></li></ol><hr /><p><strong>Discount with
      roadsurfer</strong><br />We’ve got a 12% discount for you when you book
      your motorhome through roadsurfer! Use code <strong>BETTS12</strong> at
      checkout to apply.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Restrictions</strong>: Minimum 5
      nights</p></li><li><p><strong>Code expires</strong>:
      31/12/24.</p></li></ul>

      <p><strong>Day 1: Valencia to Castellón</strong> </p><p>We landed in
      Valencia, grabbed our Road House campervan from roadsurfer and hit the
      road! Our first stop was Castellón, just over an hour’s drive away—a short
      and easy leg for our first night. We stayed at Bravoplaya, a five-star
      campsite right on the beach. At €51 a night, it isn’t cheap, but it was
      perfect for our first night. The site had everything we needed: hot
      showers, electrical plug-ins, fresh water refills, and grey water
      disposal. It was also a chance to familiarise ourselves with our new “home
      on wheels.” (Pro tip: The Road House van’s batteries charge while driving,
      so you don’t always need to plug in—very handy!)</p><p><strong>Day 2-3:
      Castellón to Cambrils</strong> </p><p>After a slow breakfast, we set off
      for Cambrils, a gorgeous seaside town on the Costa Dorada, about two hours
      north. Cambrils is a favourite holiday spot, and we quickly saw why. The
      town has a relaxed vibe, stunning beaches, and lots of free camping
      options (off-season, of course). We found a parking spot directly opposite
      the ocean—absolutely magical. If you’re up for a city adventure, Barcelona
      is a two-hour drive away or easily reached by train or bus. But honestly,
      we loved staying local, exploring the charming old town, and enjoying the
      best seafood we’ve ever had at the beachfront restaurants.</p>

      <p><strong>Day 4-5: Cambrils to Leucate, France</strong> </p><p>Next up,
      Leucate in the South of France—a solid four-hour drive. This was where
      Spain ended, and our French adventure began. We stayed at two fantastic
      Aires (motorhome parking spots): </p><p><a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/B5NLzJwdVnxUFPhG7">Port Aire </a>– €8 a
      night (add €5 for electricity). It’s along the port and has bathrooms,
      fresh water, and grey/black water disposal. </p><p><a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/EQSznBsTqirAnVgW8">Lake Aire </a>– €11 a
      night, set against the peaceful backdrop of a beautiful lake, with grey
      water dump and fresh water refill. </p><p>Leucate itself is
      postcard-perfect, with colourful facades, cobbled streets, and that
      classic French village charm. The Tourist Office offers hiking guides for
      trails starting in the village—perfect for exploring the area’s history
      and natural beauty. </p><p><strong>Day 6: Drive from Leucate to La
      Ciotat</strong> </p><p>The drive from Leucate to La Ciotat takes
      approximately 3.5 to 4 hours, depending on traffic. It’s a scenic route,
      so feel free to make stops along the way to break up the journey and soak
      in the views. The beauty of travelling in a campervan means you can pull
      into any town and make yourself some lunch in the comfort of your
      home!</p>

      <p><strong>Day 7, 8 &amp; 9: La Ciotat &amp; Cassis</strong> </p><p>A
      Paradise for Beach and Nature Lovers La Ciotat and Cassis are absolute
      must-visits for anyone who loves stunning coastlines, charming towns, and
      outdoor adventures. We highly recommend spending at least three days
      here—or longer if you can! </p><p><strong>Where to Stay</strong> </p><p>We
      parked our van at <a href="https://www.santagusta.com/en/" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Camping Santa Gusta</a> in La Ciotat, which cost €31 per
      night for a seaview pitch with electricity. The campsite was perfectly
      located, just a short walk from an Aldi grocery store and a <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/c6wKP5C9g72WVwvN7" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">fantastic bakery</a> where we bought fresh baguettes daily.
      Staying at the campsite made it easy to leave our van behind and explore
      the area using the local bus system.</p><p class="center"><img

      /></p><p><strong>Day 7: Exploring La Ciotat</strong> </p><p>Start your day
      by catching the bus to the <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mUEu8YuyGr9veaQb9" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Office de Tourisme</a>, where you can grab a map, get
      travel tips, and begin exploring the town. La Ciotat’s narrow streets are
      lined with charming cafés and shops, perfect for a leisurely stroll. Don’t
      miss the chance to visit a local bakery called <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DMTrmKp9qwLPrRec7" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Festival Des Pain</a>s, where their pain au chocolat is an
      absolute treat! Spend the rest of the day exploring La Ciotat’s narrow
      streets, soaking up its relaxed vibe, and enjoying the coastal atmosphere.
      If you happen to be in town on a Sunday, there is an amazing market on at
      the port and it’s totally worth a visit!</p><p class="center"><img

      <p><strong>Day 8: Botanical Gardens and Beaches</strong> </p><p>Catch the
      bus to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mUEu8YuyGr9veaQb9"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office de Tourisme</a> and walk about 2 km
      to the Calanque du Mugel, an incredible botanical garden with gorgeous
      beaches. Pack a picnic and your swimming gear (including a snorkel if you
      have one) because you’ll want to spend the entire day here. The <a
      href="https://en.destinationlaciotat.com/explore/the-calanques-national-park/calanque-du-mugel/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calanque du Mugel</a> features walking
      trails, lush gardens, and two inviting swimming beaches. For even more
      breathtaking scenery, take an easy 15-minute walk to <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFmNjNDGhbbpt6Gq7">Calanque de
      Figuerolles</a>, a hidden gem with turquoise waters and dramatic rock
      formations. Pro tip: bring water shoes, as many beaches in the area are
      pebbly and can be tough on bare feet. </p><p><strong>Day 9: The Route des
      Crêtes and Cassis</strong></p><p> Dedicate the morning to driving the <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CXboLp49RHnHV2Lo6" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Route des Crêtes</a>, an unforgettable coastal drive along
      the D141 between La Ciotat and Cassis. The route is narrow in some
      sections with steep inclines, but it’s manageable and well worth it for
      the stunning views. It takes about 25 minutes to drive without stopping,
      but plan for at least an hour to enjoy the viewpoints and take photos. If
      you’re feeling adventurous, bring hiking shoes as there are a few trails
      along the way. Once you arrive in Cassis, find parking using the
      Park4Night app—we paid €4 for 4 hours in a safe spot just a short walk
      from the beach. Spend the afternoon relaxing at <a

      <p><strong>Day 10 &amp; 11: Cassis to Saint-Tropez (via La
      Lavandou)</strong></p><p> If you’ve got time, Saint-Tropez is worth a
      visit, but we don’t recommend staying overnight, especially during the
      off-season. The town can feel eerily quiet, with many shops, restaurants,
      and attractions closed or under renovation in preparation for the summer
      rush. Instead, we opted to stay in La Lavandou, a charming town on the
      outskirts of Saint-Tropez. </p><p><strong>Where We Stayed</strong></p><p>
      We found an Aire right on the beach opposite <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FXeR2V14GDa2MLcn9">Plage de Cavalière</a>,
      costing €21 per night—a bit pricey for an Aire, but the beachfront
      location made up for it. While the surrounding area, including Cap Nègre,
      was quiet and mostly closed for the season, the location allowed us easy
      access to both Saint-Tropez and La Lavandou via bus.</p><p

      height="3980" width="2985" /><img src="/uploads/img-0891-2.jpg"
      height="2306" width="1320" /></p><p><strong>Day 7: Exploring La
      Ciotat</strong> </p><p>Start your day by catching the bus to the <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mUEu8YuyGr9veaQb9" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Office de Tourisme</a>, where you can grab a map, get
      travel tips, and begin exploring the town. La Ciotat’s narrow streets are
      lined with charming cafés and shops, perfect for a leisurely stroll. Don’t
      miss the chance to visit a local bakery called <a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DMTrmKp9qwLPrRec7" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Festival Des Pain</a>s, where their pain au chocolat is an
      absolute treat! Spend the rest of the day exploring La Ciotat’s narrow
      streets, soaking up its relaxed vibe, and enjoying the coastal atmosphere.
      If you happen to be in town on a Sunday, there is an amazing market on at
      the port and it’s totally worth a visit!</p><p class="center"><img

      <p>Exploring La Lavandou On Day 11, we explored the nearby town of La
      Lavandou. The streets were lovely to wander, lined with boutiques and
      cafés. Despite the season, we enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and
      picturesque beaches. We ended the day with a fantastic pizza dinner at La
      Pizza Mimi et Thierry, a local spot that we highly recommend.</p><p

      height="2306" width="1320" /><img src="/uploads/img-0662-3.jpg"
      height="4284" width="5712" /></p><p><strong>Our
      Recommendation</strong></p><p> This stretch of the French Riviera isn’t a
      must-visit during the off-season, as many areas feel closed down. However,
      if you’re keen to see Saint-Tropez and are traveling during a quieter
      time, staying in La Lavandou is a convenient and pleasant option. It
      allows you to enjoy the area without feeling too isolated or underwhelmed
      by the seasonal closures.</p><p><strong>Day 12-14: Heading Back to
      Valencia</strong></p><p> All good things come to an end, and after nearly
      two weeks of exploring, it was time to make our way back to Valencia. The
      drive is about 10 hours along the coast, but we broke it up over three
      days to savour the journey and make the most of our last stretch. If
      you’re sticking to the toll route through France, you’ll find Aires
      (motorhome stops) conveniently located every 25km, making it easy to find
      a spot to park overnight. We used the Park4Night App religiously—it’s a
      lifesaver for finding great camping spots, whether you want something
      simple or a place with full facilities. When we opted to avoid toll roads,
      we were rewarded with stunning scenic drives through small towns and
      countryside. One unexpected gem was<a
      href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9ExZFb7hnhBG3E7o6"> La Perthus</a>, a quaint
      border town with a magical charm. We only stopped for a couple of hours,
      but it completely won us over. If we had more time, we would have stayed a
      few days to explore properly.</p>

      <p>We realised during this journey that no amount of time in Europe would
      ever feel like enough. The sheer beauty, history, and culture of each stop
      made us fall more in love with the continent. Travelling in a roadsurfer
      campervan felt like pure luxury—it gave us the freedom to explore at our
      own pace and always have a cosy home waiting at the end of the day. If
      you’ve been dreaming about a shoulder-season road trip through Southern
      Europe, we hope this itinerary inspires you to start planning. And when
      you discover your own favourite spots, be sure to share them with us—we’d
      love to hear about your adventure!</p><h5><em>Till next time, Adiós, Au
