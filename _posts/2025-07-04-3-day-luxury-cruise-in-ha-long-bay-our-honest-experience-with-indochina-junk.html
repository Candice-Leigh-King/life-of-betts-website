      <p class="center"><img height="1365" width="2048"
      src="/uploads/img-4029.jpg" /></p><p class="center">We recently did a
      three-day cruise through Ha Long Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay with Indochina
      Junk, and honestly... what a bucket list experience. I don‚Äôt usually use
      the word ‚Äúmagical‚Äù when talking about boats, but this one deserved
      it.</p><p>We went with the <a
      href="https://www.dragonlegendcruise.com/3-day-2-night-cruise/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dragon Legend</em></a> ‚Äì one of their
      luxury 5-star options ‚Äì and it was all-inclusive (except drinks), which
      made the whole experience super easy. You get picked up directly from your
      hotel in Hanoi in a very fancy van (more like a lounge on wheels), and
      taken straight to the port, where your floating hotel is
      waiting.</p><p>The boat itself is beautiful ‚Äì traditional design, wood
      everywhere, but with proper modern comforts. Our room was massive,
      air-conditioned, and had the kind of bath-with-a-view situation that makes
      you stop and go: ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ how is this real?‚Äù Once we set sail, it was all
      limestone cliffs, jade-green water, and not a single stress in
      sight.</p><p>What made it even better is that they go through Bai Tu Long
      Bay ‚Äì which is kind of like Ha Long‚Äôs quieter, more untouched sibling.
      Less touristy, fewer boats, and it genuinely felt like we had the bay to
      ourselves most of the time.</p><p class="center"><img
      src="/uploads/img-4088.jpg" height="2048" width="1365" /></p><p>The
      itinerary is pretty packed (in a good way). We kayaked through hidden
      lagoons, swam off remote beaches, visited a floating fishing village, and
      learned how pearls are farmed. There was also a spring roll cooking class,
      and sunrise Tai Chi on deck if you‚Äôre more of a morning person (we tried,
      once ‚Äì the views made it worth it).</p><p>And the food. Wow. Every meal
      was about five courses ‚Äì plated and served restaurant-style ‚Äì and really
      delicious. Lots of Vietnamese flavours, loads of fresh seafood, and veggie
      options too. We never went hungry, that‚Äôs for sure.</p><p>One of the
      biggest highlights was the private beach BBQ on the second night.
      Indochina Junk is apparently the only company with permission to do this,
      and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll remember forever. The whole crew sets up dinner on
      this quiet little beach, with candles and fairy lights and music, and
      everyone just eats together, barefoot in the sand. It felt really
      special.</p><p>The whole trip costs around R7,400 per person, which covers
      all the food, activities, and the two nights on board. It‚Äôs not the
      cheapest, but when you factor in what‚Äôs included ‚Äì and how unique it felt
      ‚Äì we honestly thought it was great value.</p><p>The crew were lovely too.
      Super professional, really kind, and clearly love what they do. It‚Äôs also
      family-friendly and felt really safe, which is always something I look
      for.</p><p>If you‚Äôre heading to Vietnam and want to do Ha Long Bay without
      the chaos, this is 100% worth looking into. It‚Äôs the kind of trip that
      just sticks with you ‚Äì the views, the stillness of the bay, the quiet
      mornings out on the water. Very, very glad we did it. üêâüáªüá≥</p>
