      class="center">If you’ve ever dreamed of waking up to giraffes strolling
      past your bedroom window, you don’t need to travel far. Just 40 minutes
      outside of Cape Town you’ll find <a href="https://kalmeer.co.za/home"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kalmeer Game Farm</a>, a private game
      reserve in the Western Cape that feels like a true safari escape while
      still being so close to the city. It’s the kind of place where the moment
      you arrive, the pace slows down and nature takes over.</p><p>We stayed in
      Sable, a luxury two-sleeper house that manages to be both completely
      indulgent and wonderfully cozy. The bedroom has the softest linens and
      even electric blankets for those crisp Cape evenings, and just stepping
      inside makes you want to curl up with a glass of wine in front of the
      indoor fireplace. The bathroom is equally dreamy, with a spacious walk-in
      shower and a romantic outdoor bathtub that practically begs for a sunset
      soak under the stars.</p><p>What really makes Sable stand out is how much
      thought has gone into every detail. There’s a full kitchen with a
      Nespresso machine for lazy mornings, plush gowns for wrapping yourself up
      in comfort, and even bath salts provided to make that outdoor tub feel
      like a spa. Step outside onto the wide patio and you’ll find a braai, a
      pizza oven, and a wood-fired hottub waiting for you. Whether you’re
      cooking, soaking, or simply lounging with a good book, the views stretch
      out over the feeding area of the reserve - and that’s where the magic
      truly happens.</p><p class="center"><img src="/uploads/img-4277.jpg"
      /></p><p>Lying in bed and watching giraffes wander by is one of those
      surreal moments you never forget. At Kalmeer, the wildlife comes to you.
      From your private deck you can see kudu, zebra, wildebeest, and all sorts
      of birdlife going about their day. It feels incredibly intimate, almost as
      if the bush is performing just for you. With only a handful of private
      chalets and glamping options on the property, the reserve never feels
      crowded, making it a rare kind of peaceful that’s hard to find so close to
      the city.</p><p>What we loved most about our stay is that Kalmeer doesn’t
      just offer a place to sleep - it creates an experience. Evenings are for
      stargazing from the hottub or sharing homemade pizzas straight from the
      oven, mornings are for slow coffees while watching the animals graze, and
      afternoons are for exploring the walking paths or simply curling up by the
      fire. It’s both wild and luxurious, private yet welcoming, and it has a
      way of making you feel completely at home in the middle of the
      bush.</p><p>For anyone planning a trip to Cape Town, this is a stay worth
      adding to your itinerary. It’s close enough for a quick weekend away yet
      special enough to feel like a once-in-a-lifetime escape. Whether you’re
      celebrating something romantic, taking time to reconnect, or just craving
      a little stillness in nature, Sable at Kalmeer Game Farm is the perfect
      luxury safari near Cape Town - and pure bucket-list material.</p>
