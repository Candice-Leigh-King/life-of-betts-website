      <p class="center">Becoming a successful influencer or content creator
      doesn’t happen overnight. In our case, it’s taken us over 4 years to get
      to where we are now, and we still feel like there’s so much room to grow
      and improve. Over the past 4 years, we’ve managed to grow an audience of
      over 600,000 followers across platforms, which has allowed us to both
      leave our full-time jobs and build a 7-figure business
      together.</p><p>Looking back, if we had to start over now, we know we’d
      get there so much faster with the knowledge and experience we have today.
      So, if you’re thinking of pursuing this path, here are 5 things we believe
      are super important for getting your page off to a flying start and
      ultimately saving you from a lot of challenges as you
      grow.</p><h2><strong>1. Set SMART Goals</strong></h2><p>The first step in
      any journey is knowing where you’re headed. If you don’t know where you’re
      going, how will you ever get there? Stephen Covey puts it best in <em>The
      7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>: <strong>“Begin with the end in
      mind.”</strong></p><p>That’s where SMART goals come in Specific,
      Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound. Ask
      yourself:</p><ul><li><p>What do I want my page to look like in one, three,
      or five years?<br /></p></li><li><p>Do I want this to remain a passion
      project, or do I want it to become my full-time job?<br
      /></p></li></ul><p>Your answers will guide how you build your brand and
      the steps you need to take to get there. For example, if your long-term
      goal is to monetise, you’ll need to structure your content and
      partnerships differently than if you’re just posting for fun. SMART goals
      give you a roadmap and keep you accountable.</p><p></p>

      <h2><strong>2. Define Your Brand</strong></h2><p>Your brand is more than
      just your username, profile pic or even your logo - it’s the experience
      people have when they land on your page. And the foundation of that brand
      is your <strong>niche</strong>.</p><p>A <em>niche</em> is the specific
      area or topic you focus on. Maybe that’s travel, beauty, fitness, food,
      lifestyle, or something unique to you. Your niche tells people what they
      can expect when they follow you, and it helps brands identify whether
      you’re a good fit for them.</p><p>Within your niche, you’ll also want to
      create <strong>content pillars</strong> - the main themes or topics you
      post about regularly. For example, a fitness influencer might have pillars
      like workouts, nutrition tips, and motivation. These pillars keep your
      content organised, focused, and valuable and help you know what to post
      about.</p><p>Beyond topics, think about your brand’s <strong>emotional and
      visual tone</strong>. How do you want people to feel when they see your
      content? Inspired? Relaxed? Motivated? You can find inspiration by
      browsing Pinterest, studying creators on Instagram or TikTok you admire,
      and brainstorming what kind of content you’d love to make and what sort of
      content you could create forever without getting tired of
      it.</p><h2><strong>3. Set Up Your Professional Page</strong></h2><p>First
      impressions matter. Before you start posting, make sure your Instagram (or
      TikTok) account is set up professionally. Switch to a <strong>creator
      account</strong> so you can access insights and tools designed for
      influencers.</p><p>Here’s what to focus
      on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bio:</strong> Write a clear bio that explains
      who you are, what value you offer, and includes a strong
      <strong>call-to-action (CTA)</strong>. It needs to say who you are and why
      they should follow you.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Link:</strong> Use
      the link in your bio to direct people to your website, products, or other
      resources.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Profile Picture:</strong> Choose a
      professional, recognisable photo of you. <br
      /></p></li><li><p><strong>Story Highlights:</strong> Set up highlights as
      a “welcome” section where new followers can quickly learn who you are and
      what you’re about.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Pinned Posts:</strong> Pin
      your best-performing, most valuable posts at the top of your feed so
      people see your strongest content first.<br /></p></li></ul><p>Your
      profile is your shop window-make sure it clearly communicates your brand
      and value. The better this is set up to align with who you are and your
      brand the more likely you will be able to grow your
      community.</p><h2><strong>4. Improve Your Content
      Creation</strong></h2><p>Content is at the heart of influencing, so
      investing time into learning how to create great content is essential. A
      huge part of this is mastering the art of how to create <strong>reels and
      short-form video</strong>.</p><p>Here are some things to focus
      on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hooks:</strong> Capture attention within the
      first 3 seconds a hook can be a combination of music video and a text
      title. <br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Trending Audio:</strong> Use popular
      sounds to increase reach.<br /></p></li><li><p><strong>Quality
      Shots:</strong> Learn to use your phone properly-experiment with focal
      lengths, shoot in good lighting, and keep horizons straight.<br
      /></p></li><li><p><strong>Rule of Thirds:</strong> Turn on the grid on
      your phone and use it to compose balanced, professional-looking shots.<br
      /></p></li><li><p><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Every video should tell a
      story or deliver clear value.<br /></p></li></ul><p>And remember-your
      content should align with your brand strategy. Post with the intention of
      what content pillar each content piece is for. The more you refine your
      skills in shooting, editing, and storytelling, the more your content will
      stand out. Use Apps like VN for videos and Lightroom for photos to help
      you edit.</p><h2><strong>5. Engage and Build a
      Community</strong></h2><p>You don't just want followers but rather a
      community this is what truly builds influence. Your focus should be
      maintaining a high engagement rate as when you grow this will become your
      secret super power. If people feel connected to you, they’ll stick around,
      share your content, and support your journey.</p><p>Make it a priority
      to:</p><ul><li><p>Reply to DMs.<br /></p></li><li><p>Respond to
      comments.<br /></p></li><li><p>Support other creators by engaging with
      their content.<br /></p><p>Think of your page as a two-way conversation,
      not just a broadcast. The stronger your community, the easier it will be
      to attract brands, grow your audience, and eventually monetise your
      platform.</p></li></ul><p></p>
