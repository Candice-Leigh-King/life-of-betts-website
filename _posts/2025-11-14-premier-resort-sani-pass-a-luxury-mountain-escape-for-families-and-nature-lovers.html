      class="center">If you’re craving fresh mountain air, uninterrupted views
      and a resort that has absolutely everything you need for the perfect
      escape, <a href="https://www.premierhotels.co.za/sani-pass/about-us"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Premier Resort Sani Pass</a> needs to be on
      your list. Set in the heart of the Southern Drakensberg, this gorgeous
      mountain resort is peaceful, family friendly and packed with activities
      for every age. 🍃⛰️✨</p><p>We stayed in the Suite King, and honestly, we
      didn’t want to leave. It’s one of those spaces where you immediately feel
      relaxed. The suite is beautifully spacious with a super king bed, indoor
      fireplace, walk-in shower, a bathtub big enough for a proper soak, and
      panoramic mountain views that make you want to slow right down and savour
      every moment.</p><p class="center">The resort really shines when it comes
      to facilities and activities. Whether you’re a couple wanting to unwind, a
      family with energetic kids, or someone who loves the outdoors, there is
      truly something for everyone here. Guests can enjoy guided hikes,
      self-guided walking trails, horse riding trails, two swimming pools
      including a heated one, a gorgeous on-site waterfall, a spa, a restaurant
      and bar, a kids club area, a games room and loads of family friendly
      activities. It’s the kind of place where you can do everything, or nothing
      at all, depending on what you’re in the mood for.</p><p>We loved how easy
      it was to reconnect with nature here. The mountains wrap around the
      resort, and no matter where you are - in your suite, at breakfast, by the
      pool or out exploring - the views are spectacular. It’s peaceful, quiet,
      and the perfect escape from life’s busyness.</p><p class="center">The
      suites offer everything you need for a comfortable stay. Along with the
      mountain views and super king bed, you’ll have a sleeper couch, a separate
      lounge area, a kitchenette, free high speed WiFi, and a workstation if you
      need to catch up on anything while you’re away. Inter-leading rooms are
      also available if you’re travelling as a larger family.</p><p>One of the
      biggest drawcards of staying at Premier Resort Sani Pass is being right
      near the iconic Sani Pass. This steep, rugged mountain road connects South
      Africa to Lesotho and is famous for its dramatic scenery, hairpin bends
      and incredible 4x4 adventures. At the top you can even grab a drink at the
      highest pub in Africa. Whether you take a guided tour or simply admire the
      landscapes from below, it’s a must do experience in this region.</p><p
      class="center">Premier Resort Sani Pass truly offers the best mix of
      relaxation and adventure. You can spend your morning hiking, your
      afternoon lounging by the pool, and your evenings cosy inside your suite
      with the fireplace going. It’s ideal for families, couples and anyone
      wanting to switch off, unwind and spend time in nature.</p><p
      class="center">If you’re planning your next Drakensberg getaway,
      definitely save this one. It’s peaceful, luxurious and surrounded by some
      of the most beautiful landscapes in South Africa. 🍃⛰️✨</p>
