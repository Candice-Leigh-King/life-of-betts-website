      class="center">If you’re looking for an easy weekend escape from
      Johannesburg that has nature, adventure and relaxation all in one, <a
      href="https://riverrafting.co.za/2-bedroom-en-suite-tents/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hadeda Creek</a> needs to be at the top of
      your list. Just two hours from the city, this beautiful riverfront
      property sits along the pristine Vaal River inside the UNESCO listed
      Vredefort Dome and offers the kind of fun filled getaway that the whole
      family will love. 🍃😍⛰️</p><p>We stayed in the Bush Camp two bedroom en
      suite tent and it was such a treat. This luxury glamping tent sits on a
      raised wooden deck overlooking the river, giving you those peaceful water
      views from the moment you wake up. The tent is incredibly spacious and
      perfect for couples, friends or families. It has two separate bedrooms,
      each with its own en suite bathroom, plus a fully equipped kitchen and a
      four seater dining table. The interior is comfortable, homely and
      thoughtfully designed, and all linen and bath towels are provided. It
      completely removes the “roughing it” element of camping and gives you a
      cosy, modern glamping experience instead.</p><p class="center"><img
      src="/uploads/img-7410.jpg" /></p><p class="center">The best part about
      staying at Hadeda Creek is how much there is to do on the property.
      Whether you’re visiting as a couple, a group of friends or a family with
      kids, everyone will find something they love. Guests can enjoy
      <strong>fishing, white water rafting, horse rides, e bikes, multiple
      swimming pools, braai areas, a zip line, jungle gym and loads of outdoor
      adventures</strong>. The property also has an onsite restaurant serving
      delicious meals, which makes it even easier if you don’t feel like
      cooking. 😍</p><p>The atmosphere is relaxed, friendly and completely
      surrounded by nature. Hadeda Creek describes itself as informal and enviro
      friendly, and that’s exactly how it feels. You can spend the morning
      rafting on the river, the afternoon relaxing by the pool, and the evening
      braaing next to your glamping tent. It is one of those places where you
      instantly feel far away from the city, even though it is such an easy
      drive from Johannesburg.</p><p class="center">There’s also the bonus that
      Hadeda Creek is great for day visitors. If you’re not staying the night,
      you can still come for activities, river adventures and good food with a
      view.</p><p class="center">Our stay in the Bush Camp tent was peaceful,
      fun and filled with those simple outdoor moments that make a getaway
      unforgettable. If you’re planning a family trip, a nature weekend or a
      little adventure escape close to the city, definitely save this one. It is
      beautiful, affordable and packed with things to do. 🥰🙌✨</p>
