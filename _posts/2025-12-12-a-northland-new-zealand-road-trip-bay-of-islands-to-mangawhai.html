      class="center">Northland announces itself long before you reach the
      coast.</p><p class="center">The land opens up first - rolling farmland in
      every shade of green, hills dotted with sheep stretching into the
      distance, and huge ferns and trees lining the roads. And then, without
      warning, the sea appears. Bright blue and so inviting, catching the light
      between dramatic peninsulas and island-dotted horizons. </p><p>This trip
      felt especially special because we weren’t just exploring Northland for
      ourselves - we were sharing it with my parents. They live in the Bay of
      Plenty and this was their very first visit to this part of the country.
      For us, it was our second time here, and we loved getting to show them
      places we already adored, while discovering new favourites together.
      Seeing the region again through their eyes made everything feel
      fresh.</p><p class="center">This trip to Northland felt full. Full of
      colour, warmth and movement. Long drives broken up by car naps, coffee
      stops in small towns with great little cafés, and spontaneous detours to
      beaches or viewpoints we’d saved on Instagram. Our days unfolded easily.
      Early morning walks with my mom while the air was still cool. Long,
      delicious meals shared around tables. Late evening dips in the ocean with
      Josh, my dad and me, the water warm and calm as the sun slipped
      away.</p><p>Follow our exact itinerary below - </p><h2>Day 1: Bay of
      Plenty to the Bay of Islands</h2><p><strong>Auckland → Opua</strong><br
      /><em>All drive times are approximate</em></p><p>We set off early from the
      Bay of Plenty, heading north towards the Bay of Islands - one of those
      drives that quietly reminds you how wildly beautiful Aotearoa really is.
      Rolling farmland slowly gave way to lush greenery and coastal glimpses
      before we arrived in Opua.</p><h3>🌲 Stay: Rekindle Treehouses,
      Opua</h3><p><strong>Treetop Tranquillity – Double Rooms</strong><br
      />Website: <a href="https://www.rekindletreehouses.com" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Rekindle Treehouses</a></p><p>Hidden among four acres of
      native bush, Rekindle Treehouses feels like a true forest hideaway. Two
      beautifully designed standalone treehouses sit elevated among the trees,
      each with its own balcony and braai - the kind of place that instantly
      invites you to exhale.</p><p>We woke to birdsong, filtered light through
      the leaves, and that wonderful feeling of being completely tucked away,
      yet still just minutes from Paihia and the wider Bay of
      Islands.</p><p>It’s romantic, peaceful and thoughtfully designed - ideal
      if you’re looking to reset before exploring the region.</p><h4
      class="center"><img title="Rekindle Treehouses, Opua"
      src="/uploads/b2121d31-181f-4e30-a720-89013c370628-1.jpeg" /></h4><h3>🧺
      Dinner Delivered: The Picnic Box</h3><p>Website: <a
      href="https://thepicnicboxboi.co.nz/?srsltid=AfmBOorVKTnSUGJ75FRpO8tc8cJDr4vVWnwiANRWcY4fWlh8CwakIywM"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Picnic Box</a></p><p>That evening, we
      opted for a gourmet BBQ box from The Picnic Box - and honestly, this was
      such a treat after a long drive. The box was filled with locally sourced,
      seasonal ingredients, beautifully prepared and ready to enjoy with minimal
      effort.</p><p>We lit the braai, poured a glass of wine, and enjoyed dinner
      on the deck as the forest settled around us. Simple, special, and exactly
      what we needed.</p><hr /><h2>Day 2: Bay of Islands on the Water &amp;
      Russell by Sunset</h2><p><strong>Opua → Paihia → Bay of Islands →
      Russell</strong></p><p>After breakfast, we drove just 15 minutes to Paihia
      and parked at <strong>Williams Road Public Car Park</strong>, an easy
      all-day option just a short walk from the wharf.</p><h3>🚤 Experience:
      Discover the Bay Cruise – Explore Group Bay of Islands</h3><p>Website: <a
      href="https://www.exploregroup.co.nz/bay-of-islands/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22357745914&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADn_Ex-d9wg80w5f98MLjNyiZ6dnQ&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_ls2NKgUmrj5nSN-aMnGCQ9S-AviwTVrWaWho6HpAR3mzjCdDq7yA5caAraxEALw_wcB"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explore Group Bay of Islands</a></p><p>At
      10am, we boarded our Discover the Bay cruise - a quintessential Bay of
      Islands experience. With full commentary from a knowledgeable local
      skipper, we cruised past dramatic cliffs, historic sites and island-dotted
      horizons.</p><p>Conditions allowed us to head out towards Cape Brett and
      through the iconic Hole in the Rock (absolute bucket list stuff!),  we
      kept our eyes peeled for marine life - dolphins, seals and seabirds are
      often spotted along the way.</p><p>The cruise includes a stop at
      <strong>Otehei Bay on Urupukapuka Island</strong>, where lunch is
      included. You can swim at the sandy bay, explore the island or simply soak
      up the sunshine with a drink from the café. It’s relaxed, scenic and
      incredibly well-paced.</p><h4 class="center"><img title="Hole in the Rock
      Tour" src="/uploads/0d2c09c4-f1b6-451e-80ab-57079fd3c97c.jpeg"
      /></h4><h3>🏖️ Stay: Edgewater Palms Apartments,
      Paihia</h3><p><strong>Two-Bedroom Waterfront Apartment</strong><br
      />Website: <a href="https://edgewaterapartments.co.nz" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Edgewater Palms Apartments</a></p><p>That afternoon, we
      checked into Edgewater Palms — absolute waterfront, golden sands at your
      doorstep, and views stretching across the bay towards Russell.</p><p>From
      dolphins cruising past in the late afternoon to pastel sunrise skies the
      next morning, this is one of those places where the location truly does
      the heavy lifting. Spacious, comfortable and perfectly positioned, it’s an
      ideal base for exploring the Bay of Islands.</p><h4
      class="center"></h4><h3>⛴️ Evening Ferry to Russell</h3><p>We caught the
      passenger ferry from Paihia to Russell (15 minutes each way). Tickets are
      purchased at the ferry, and the crossing itself is part of the
      charm.</p><h3>🍽️ Dinner: Duke of Marlborough, Russell</h3><p>Website: <a
      href="https://www.theduke.co.nz/eat-and-drink" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Duke of Marlborough </a></p><p>This was our second visit to
      the Duke - and once again, it delivered. Live music, generous portions,
      and sunset views over the bay that are genuinely hard to
      beat.</p><p>Holding New Zealand’s first liquor licence, the Duke is
      steeped in history yet feels wonderfully relaxed. If you’re not staying in
      Russell, we highly recommend catching an earlier ferry so you can explore
      the village.</p><h4 class="center"></h4><p><strong>Local tips in
      Russell:</strong><br />• Grab a coffee from <strong>The French Coffee
      House</strong> - their takeaway cups are almost too pretty to throw
      away<br />• Wander the historic streets, pop into the op shop and local
      boutiques<br />• Walk the <strong>Tapeka Point Track</strong> - an easy
      500m each way with beautiful coastal views</p><h4 class="center"><img
      title="Russell and Paihia "
      src="/uploads/1d2a6e07-7965-49fc-abf3-4e32de0541f9.jpeg" /></h4><hr
      /><h2>Day 3: Vineyards, Ferries &amp; the Secret Coast
      Route</h2><p><strong>Paihia → Russell → Tutukaka</strong></p><p>We boarded
      the <strong>Opua Car Ferry</strong> in the morning — a smooth, efficient
      crossing that runs frequently throughout the day. Tickets are purchased
      onboard, and it’s a fun little Northland experience in itself.</p><h3>🍕
      Lunch: Omata Estate Vineyard &amp; Kitchen</h3><p>Website:<a
      href="https://www.omata.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Omata
      Estate Vineyard &amp; Kitchen</a></p><p>Set on a sunny peninsula
      overlooking the ocean, Omata Estate is the kind of place you plan to stay
      for an hour and accidentally linger for three.</p><p>We enjoyed wood-fired
      pizzas, gourmet platters and a glass of local wine, all while soaking up
      sweeping coastal views. There’s also a lovely bush walk through the
      vineyard - well worth doing before or after lunch.</p><p>Relaxed, rustic
      and quietly spectacular.</p><h4 class="center"><img title="Omata Estate
      Vineyard &amp; Kitchen"
      src="/uploads/6e8c82f2-3d43-422a-8601-8b8809fb4883-1.jpeg" /></h4><h3>🚗
      Scenic Drive: Secret Coast Route</h3><p>From Russell, we followed the <a
      href="https://www.northlandnz.com/visit/northland-journeys/secret-coast-route/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Secret Coast Route</strong>
      </a>towards Tutukaka - a two-hour drive packed with hidden bays, rolling
      farmland and unexpected ocean views. Download the route map via Northland
      Tourism before you go; it’s one of those journeys where the drive really
      is part of the experience.</p><h3>🌴 Stay: Lodge 9,
      Tutukaka</h3><p>Website: <a href="https://www.lodge9.co.nz"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lodge 9 Tutukaka</a></p><p>Tucked away in a
      private valley just behind Tutukaka Marina, Lodge 9 is a boutique retreat
      done beautifully. Salvaged marina piles and boardwalks have been upcycled
      into a lush, tropical paradise complete with a saltwater pool, cedar sauna
      and leafy courtyard.</p><p>The rooms are stylish and comfortable,
      breakfast is included, and you’re within walking distance of bars and
      restaurants - an ideal base for exploring the Tutukaka Coast.</p><hr
      /><h2>Day 4: A Perfect Day at the Poor Knights Islands</h2><h3>🤿
      Experience: Perfect Day – Dive! Tutukaka</h3><p>Website: <a
      href="https://diving.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dive!
      Tutukaka</a></p><p>This was, quite simply, one of the
      <strong>highlights</strong> of our entire trip.</p><p>The <strong>Perfect
      Day</strong> experience with Dive! Tutukaka is designed for non-divers and
      offers an unforgettable way to explore the Poor Knights Islands - often
      rated among the best subtropical marine reserves in the
      world.</p><p>Snorkelling, kayaking, paddleboarding, cave exploration,
      island history, and incredible food - all delivered by an outstanding crew
      who genuinely care about the experience.</p><p>The water was crystal-clear
      and an almost unreal shade of blue. We saw schools of fish, explored
      beneath towering cliffs, and spent hours in and out of the ocean. The team
      even provided a floating viewing board so my mum could comfortably enjoy
      snorkelling too - such a thoughtful touch.</p><p>If you do one activity in
      Northland, make it this.</p><p>We returned to <strong>Lodge 9</strong>
      that evening tired, sun-kissed and completely content.</p><h4
      class="center"><img loading="true" title="Poor Knights Islands"
      src="/uploads/a28bf07a-539b-468f-a868-67db6272afba-1.jpeg" /></h4><hr
      /><h2>Day 5: Waterfalls, Art &amp; Coastal
      Wellness</h2><p><strong>Tutukaka → Whangārei →
      Mangawhai</strong></p><h3>🌊Experience: Whangārei Falls</h3><p>A short
      detour on the drive south, Whangārei Falls drops 26.3 metres over basalt
      cliffs and is easily accessed via viewing platforms and short walking
      tracks. There are picnic areas, forest views and multiple vantage points -
      perfect for stretching your legs.</p><h4 class="center"><img
      loading="lazy" title="Whangārei Falls"
      src="/uploads/9c1445a6-d9a0-4ccf-b192-67d3ae430b6b.jpeg" /></h4><h3>🎨
      Experience: Hundertwasser Art Centre Guided Tour</h3><p>Website: <a
      href="https://www.hundertwasserartcentre.co.nz" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Hundertwasser Art Centre</a></p><p>Located in Whangārei’s
      Town Basin, the Hundertwasser Art Centre is an architectural masterpiece.
      A guided tour adds real depth, offering insight into Hundertwasser’s
      ecological vision, art, and connection to nature, alongside the Wairau
      Māori Art Gallery.</p><p>It’s inspiring, thought-provoking and a wonderful
      cultural stop on your journey south.</p><h3>🍽️ Lunch: Aqua Restaurant
      &amp; Bar</h3><p>Website: <a href="https://aquawhangarei.co.nz"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aqua Restaurant and
      Bar</a></p><p>Overlooking the marina, Aqua serves fresh, seasonal dishes
      inspired by flavours from New Zealand and beyond. Locally sourced seafood,
      vibrant plates and a relaxed atmosphere made this a perfect midday
      pause.</p><h3>🚗 Scenic Drive to Mangawhai</h3><p>The coastal drive to
      Mangawhai is dotted with tempting swim stops. <strong>Ruakākā
      Beach</strong> is ideal for a dip, while <strong>Waipu Cove</strong> makes
      for a great coffee stop.</p><h3>🛏️ Stay: Mangawhai
      Lodge</h3><p><strong>Heritage Deluxe Apartment</strong><br />Website: <a
      href="https://seaviewlodge.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mangawhai
      Lodge</a></p><p>A cosy overnight stop with sweeping sea views, Mangawhai
      Lodge is perfectly placed for exploring the village and surrounding
      beaches.</p><h3>🧖‍♀️ Experience: Tiki Beach, Mangawhai</h3><p>Website: <a
      href="https://www.tikibeach.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiki
      Beach Mangawhai</a></p><p>We ended our Northland adventure with pure
      relaxation at <strong>Tiki Beach</strong> - Mangawhai’s first club-style
      day spa. Hot tubs, sauna, ice baths and tropical vibes made this the
      ultimate wind-down after a big week of exploring.</p><h4
