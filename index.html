          <p>Our Instagram followers more than doubled from 4300 to over 8600
            followers from your visit till today and are still rising daily.
            We have had 15 new bookings for Stone Mountain Lodge and there
            was an additional spin-off on our other accommodation options. We
            also received more than 80 inquiries for Stone Mountain Lodge from
            the post either via email requests in the comments section or on the
            website.</p> <p>Website traffic increased as follows for the last 30 days to the previous 30 days</p> <p>Traffic sources</p> <p>Instagram up 2169%</p> <p>Google up 243%</p><p>Direct up 222%</p><p>Facebook up 110%</p><p>96% of New Guests on the website</p><p> 455% Increase in website visits</p><p>We loved hosting Josh and Ruth. Their dedication, professionalism,
              and work ethic were commendable. From waking up at 3 am
              reaching us by 6 am, handling unforeseen bad weather, and
              adapting accordingly. They did not shy away from the challenges
              (presented by the weather) and still went hiking and swimming to
              capture the needed content showing complete dedication. Their
              posts and stories portrayed an authentic experience and attracted
              our specific target market beautifully as a result. We would highly
              recommend them.</p>

          <p>To say they super exceeded my expectations is an understatement. I
            did not expect the kind of traffic I got on my social media page, let
            alone my website. My Instagram following increased by about 3000
            followers, my website traffic went from about 300 visitors a day to
            close to 1500. To date, I have received about 10 bookings that have
            stemmed directly from their posts, and am still getting inquiries
            every day. Ruth & Josh are a lovely couple. They are good, honest
            people that follow through with their promises. I would highly
            suggest any kind of working relationship with them. Thank you,
            Ruth & Josh, it's been a pleasure. I hope to have you stay with us
            again in the future. All the best for your travels.</p>

          <p>Since our first interaction, Ruthie and Josh have been welcoming
            and a breath of fresh air. They are such pure souls. Since we met in

            part of their journey and see how much they have grown.</p><p>We have experienced nothing short of perfection from them. Their deliverables are on point, and the content is top-notch. We have met numerous coffee lovers via their content, and we look forward to bringing quality coffee to other adventurers as well.</p><p>They are a treat to collaborate with. I recommend them to any brand that wants to up its marketing game.</p><p>We are excited to see where we are going next and explore the world with "Life of Betts".</p>
