          Their dedication, professionalism, and work ethic were commendable.
          From waking up at 3 am reaching us by 6<br />am, handling unforeseen
          bad weather, and adapting accordingly. They did<br />not shy away from
          the challenges (presented by the weather) and still went hiking and
          swimming to capture the needed content showing complete dedication.
          Their posts and stories portrayed an authentic experience and
          attracted our specific target market beautifully as a result. We would
          highly recommend them."</p>

          <h3><em>Giants Cup Wilderness Reserve</em></h3><p>"To say they super
          exceeded my expectations is an understatement. I did not expect the
          kind of traffic I got on my social media page, let alone my<br
          />website. My Instagram following increased by about 3000 followers,
          my website traffic went from about 300 visitors a day to close to
          1500. To date, I have received about 10 bookings that have stemmed
          directly from their posts, and am still getting inquiries every day.
          Ruth &amp; Josh are a lovely couple. They are good, honest people that
          follow through with their<br />promises. I would highly suggest any
          kind of working relationship with them.<br />Thank you, Ruth &amp;
          Josh, it&rsquo;s been a pleasure. I hope to have you stay with us
          again in the future. All the best for your
          travels."</p><h5><em>Fouriesburg Tourism</em></h5><p>"These two are

          our little town of Fouriesburg and all the things that make
          Fouriesburg<br />so special. We also chatted for hours and they gave
          us some amazing<br />advice. Their trip increased our social media
          following as they were constantly taking photos and posting on social
          media and tagging us. We<br />believe they definitely add value to any
          place that would like to collaborate<br />with them. They are down to
