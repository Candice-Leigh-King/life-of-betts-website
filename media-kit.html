      professionalism, and<br />work ethic were commendable. From waking up at 3
      am reaching us by 6<br />am, handling unforeseen bad weather, and adapting
      accordingly. They did<br />not shy away from the challenges (presented by
      the weather) and still went<br />hiking and swimming to capture the needed
      content showing complete<br />dedication. Their posts and stories
      portrayed an authentic experience and<br />attracted our specific target
      market beautifully as a result. We would highly<br />recommend them.
